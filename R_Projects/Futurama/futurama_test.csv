",6,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Not on the same channel, of course.

",47,2,1,2,Farnsworth,H.G. BlobH.G. Blob,"  Evans! Where's that package from Earth?
",42,2,1,2,Announcer #1,Man #1Man #1,"  Uh...   I'm not Evans!
",25,2,1,2,H.G. Blob,H.G. BlobH.G. Blob,"  He should've used Planet Express!
",36,2,1,2,Man #1,Announcer #1Announcer #1,"  When those other companies aren't brave or foolhardy enough to go, trust Planet Express for reliable, on time delivery.
",122,2,1,2,H.G. Blob,EvansEvans,"  Here's your package, Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob.
",53,2,1,2,Announcer #1,H.G. BlobH.G. Blob,"  Good work, Evans! You've got a future around here.

",18,2,1,2,H.G. Blob,Announcer #1Announcer #1,"  Planet Express: Our crew is replaceable. Your package isn't.
",63,2,1,2,Evans,FryFry," Are there really giant birds like that?
",41,2,1,2,Announcer #1,FarnsworthFarnsworth," No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.
",98,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," I'm never going to get used to the 31st century.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
",107,2,1,2,Farnsworth,LeelaLeela," Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula.
",58,2,1,2,Fry,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you.
",125,2,1,2,Leela,HermesHermes," Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?
",105,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose.
",76,2,1,2,Hermes,FryFry," Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
",21,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Hmm, you!
",11,2,1,2,Fry,HermesHermes," OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen.

",28,2,1,2,Hermes,HermesHermes," Mm.

",27,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible.
",104,2,1,2,Hermes,HermesHermes," Sign the paper!
",17,2,1,2,Leela,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual.  He wears sandals!
",145,2,1,2,Hermes,FryFry," Hi--
",6,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.
",71,2,1,2,Fry,ZoidbergZoidberg," Excellent, excellent!
",23,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FarnsworthFarnsworth," You'll be fine.
",17,2,1,2,Zoidberg,ZoidbergZoidberg," Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain.  No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!
",95,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FryFry," I only have one.
",18,2,1,2,Zoidberg,ZoidbergZoidberg," Really?
",9,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Uh, is there a human doctor around?
",37,2,1,2,Zoidberg,ZoidbergZoidberg," Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say...  What? My mother was a saint! Get out!
",114,2,1,2,Fry,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
",35,2,1,2,Zoidberg,BenderBender," Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
",46,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?
",71,2,1,2,Bender,AmyAmy," OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
",39,2,1,2,Farnsworth,LeelaLeela," Ow!
",5,2,1,2,Amy,BenderBender," A little.
",11,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?
",74,2,1,2,Bender,FarnsworthFarnsworth," As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine.  I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me.
",187,2,1,2,Fry,AmyAmy," Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?
",61,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FryFry,"  Last time I checked.
",23,2,1,2,Amy,LeelaLeela," Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
",39,2,1,2,Fry,AmyAmy," Look, we're not as rich as everybody says.
",44,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
",41,2,1,2,Amy,AmyAmy,"  Kappa Kappa Wong.
",20,2,1,2,Leela,BenderBender," Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining.   Look at my head. It's all painted! Look at my head! I got a big, old head, hey! Ho!   Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
",195,2,1,2,Amy,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Ah, to be young again. And also a robot. Now, as I recall, you youngsters have a package to deliver.
",102,2,1,2,Bender,FryFry," Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!
",40,2,1,2,Farnsworth,BenderBender," Nice catch, idiot!
",20,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," So where are we going anyway?
",31,2,1,2,Bender,LeelaLeela," Nowhere special. The moon.
",28,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
",132,2,1,2,Leela,AmyAmy," Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?
",52,2,1,2,Fry,LeelaLeela," Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
",121,2,1,2,Amy,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Nothing will go wrong.   If something goes wrong, bring back the blood.
",73,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," Can I do the countdown?
",25,2,1,2,Farnsworth,LeelaLeela," Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out.
",36,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Ten ...  ... nine--
",21,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," OK, we're here!
",17,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry,"  Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!
",44,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
",33,2,1,2,Fry,LeelaLeela," Relax. It's open till 9.
",26,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," That's one small step for Fry--
",33,2,1,2,Leela,Man #1Man #1," And one giant line for admission!
",35,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Wow!  Um, can I have cuts?
",28,2,1,2,Man #1,Man #1Man #1," Hmm ... no!
",13,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
",78,2,1,2,Man #1,AmyAmy," Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
",46,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Let's go, already!
",20,2,1,2,Amy,LeelaLeela," Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
",34,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
",58,2,1,2,Leela,BenderBender," Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
",65,2,1,2,Fry,LeelaLeela," OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--
",43,2,1,2,Bender,FryFry," I had more but you go ahead.
",30,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
",69,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," But I've never been to the moon before.
",41,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.  Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.
",197,2,1,2,Fry,AmyAmy," Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir-- Um, ma'am!
",71,2,1,2,Leela,AmyAmy," Clear?
",8,2,1,2,Amy,FryFry," Clear!
",8,2,1,2,Amy,AmyAmy," Ready to hoist?
",17,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Ready!
",8,2,1,2,Amy,AmyAmy," Ow!
",5,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," My first space delivery.
",26,2,1,2,Amy,FryFry," Uh, greetings, Moon Man. We come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
",76,2,1,2,Fry,SalSal," Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
",66,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," But you are lazy, right?
",26,2,1,2,Sal,SalSal," Oh, don't get me started.
",27,2,1,2,Fry,CraterfaceCraterface," Hi, I'm Craterface! Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir.
",86,2,1,2,Sal,BenderBender," Better mascots than you have tried.
",37,2,1,2,Craterface,CraterfaceCraterface," At least I still have my self respect!
",40,2,1,2,Bender,LeelaLeela," Who buys this trash?
",22,2,1,2,Craterface,BenderBender," Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
",41,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
",43,2,1,2,Bender,BenderBender," Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh!   How many roads must a man walk down, before you--   Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!
",161,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
",63,2,1,2,Bender,BenderBender," Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
",72,2,1,2,Fry,WhalerbotsWhalerbots,"  We're whalers on the moon,
We carry a harpoon,
But there ain't no whales,
So we tell our tall tale,
And sing our whaling tune!
",129,2,1,2,Bender,WhalerbotWhalerbot," Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!
",33,2,1,2,Whalerbots,BenderBender," Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!
",48,2,1,2,Whalerbot,Announcer #1Announcer #1," Monsanto presents: The Goophy Gopher Revue!
",45,2,1,2,Bender,Gopher #1Gopher #1," Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
",55,2,1,2,Announcer #1,Gopher #2Gopher #2," Because it's a little meteor!
",31,2,1,2,Gopher #1,FryFry," This is weak!
",15,2,1,2,Gopher #2,Gopher #1Gopher #1," Address all complaints to the Monsanto corporation.
",53,2,1,2,Fry,LeelaLeela," What's wrong, Fry?
",20,2,1,2,Gopher #1,FryFry," I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth.  That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!
",248,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
",60,2,1,2,Fry,BenderBender," Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
",90,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
",158,2,1,2,Bender,FryFry," I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
",50,2,1,2,Leela,BenderBender,"  Next year in Jerusalem!
",26,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
",50,2,1,2,Bender,NarratorNarrator,"  The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
",75,2,1,2,Fry,Ralph Kramden-botRalph Kramden-bot," One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!
",61,2,1,2,Narrator,LeelaLeela," Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
",57,2,1,2,Ralph Kramden-bot,FryFry," That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
",117,2,1,2,Leela,AmyAmy," Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball!  Hm?
",64,2,1,2,Fry,BenderBender," Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
",57,2,1,2,Amy,AmyAmy," The keys to the ship!  They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
",85,2,1,2,Bender,BenderBender," Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
",37,2,1,2,Amy,AmyAmy," Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
",53,2,1,2,Bender,SalSal," What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
",44,2,1,2,Amy,NarratorNarrator,"  No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon.
",64,2,1,2,Sal,FryFry," I do.
",7,2,1,2,Narrator,NarratorNarrator,"  But our fun-gineers think it might have happened something like this:
",72,2,1,2,Fry,WhalerbotsWhalerbots,"  We're whalers on the moon,
",29,2,1,2,Narrator,GophersGophers,"  We carry a harpoon,
",22,2,1,2,Whalerbots,WhalerbotsWhalerbots," and   But there ain't no whales so we tell a tall tale...
",59,2,1,2,Gophers,LeelaLeela,"  And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
",55,2,1,2,Whalerbots,FryFry," That's not how it happened.
",29,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!
",58,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
",61,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.
",111,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Not for long!
",15,2,1,2,Leela,WhalerbotWhalerbot," Ooh! Ah! I died doin' what I loved.
",37,2,1,2,Fry,LeelaLeela," OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
",138,2,1,2,Whalerbot,FryFry," Agreed.  Yeah! Crank up the radio!
",36,2,1,2,Leela,WhalerbotsWhalerbots,"  We're whalers on the--
",25,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Yee-haw!
",10,2,1,2,Whalerbots,LeelaLeela," Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
",46,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
",71,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
",45,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Well I'm feelin' lucky!  Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
",59,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," We're gonna die! It's every man for himself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! We're safe!
",88,2,1,2,Fry,LeelaLeela," No. Now we're gonna die.
",26,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," It's every man for himself.
",29,2,1,2,Leela,BenderBender," Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
",47,2,1,2,Fry,AmyAmy," Shut up. You're distracting me.
",33,2,1,2,Bender,BenderBender," Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor.
",91,2,1,2,Amy,AmyAmy," I know how to make love!
",26,2,1,2,Bender,BenderBender," Here, let me do it.  Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged!  That's her, officers!  Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!
",126,2,1,2,Amy,BenderBender," Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
",105,2,1,2,Bender,FryFry,"  I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.
",93,2,1,2,Bender,LeelaLeela," Thank God!
",12,2,1,2,Fry,Hydroponic FarmerHydroponic Farmer," Trespassers, eh?
",18,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
",40,2,1,2,Hydroponic Farmer,FarmerFarmer," Ooh, that's a wicked sinful place. Tilt-a-whirl's OK, but the rest is mighty wicked.
",86,2,1,2,Fry,LeelaLeela," Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
",65,2,1,2,Farmer,FarmerFarmer," Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up.
",178,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
",45,2,1,2,Farmer,LeelaLeela," Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
",41,2,1,2,Fry,FarmerFarmer," Yup. Drops down to -173!
",26,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," Fahrenheit or Celsius?
",24,2,1,2,Farmer,FarmerFarmer," First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain't goin' nowhere till sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?
",199,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," Robot daughters?
",18,2,1,2,Farmer,FarmerFarmer," This here is Lulabelle 7.
",27,2,1,2,Fry,Lulabelle 7Lulabelle 7," Yoo-hoo!
",10,2,1,2,Farmer,FarmerFarmer," Daisy-Mae 128K.
",17,2,1,2,Lulabelle 7,Daisy-Mae KDaisy-Mae K," Yoo-hoo!
",10,2,1,2,Farmer,FarmerFarmer," And the Crushinator.
",22,2,1,2,Daisy-Mae K,CrushinatorCrushinator,"  Yoo-hoo.
",11,2,1,2,Farmer,FryFry," Whoa!
",7,2,1,2,Crushinator,LeelaLeela," I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.
",118,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
",132,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Fry, face it: The moon is a dump. It's a boring, dried-up wasteland and the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?
",181,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," I guess I can't.
",18,2,1,2,Leela,FarmerFarmer," I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
",49,2,1,2,Fry,BenderBender," He'll never find me in here.
",30,2,1,2,Farmer,LeelaLeela," Bender?
",9,2,1,2,Bender,FryFry," Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
",56,2,1,2,Leela,BenderBender," Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
",58,2,1,2,Fry,FarmerFarmer," Oh, no you don't! C'mere, Crushinator.
",40,2,1,2,Bender,CrushinatorCrushinator,"  Yes, Pa.
",11,2,1,2,Farmer,FryFry," It's too low.
",15,2,1,2,Crushinator,LeelaLeela," Hang on. Hang on. Jump!  Hold on to your helmet!
",50,2,1,2,Fry,FarmerFarmer," God darn it, Crushinator, jump!
",33,2,1,2,Leela,CrushinatorCrushinator,"  No, Pa. I love him.
",22,2,1,2,Farmer,FryFry," Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
",35,2,1,2,Crushinator,LeelaLeela," Nightfall's coming.  Hurry, before we freeze.
",47,2,1,2,Fry,BenderBender," What do you mean ""we"", mammal?
",32,2,1,2,Leela,FarnsworthFarnsworth," Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.
",75,2,1,2,Bender,LeelaLeela," We can't outrun it forever.
",29,2,1,2,Farnsworth,FryFry," Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
",60,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Quick, get in.
",16,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint!  Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
",137,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust.  Now get in here before you freeze.
",124,2,1,2,Fry,BenderBender," Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.
",178,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
",76,2,1,2,Bender,FryFry," Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
",67,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.
",81,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
",241,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," A week would be a little much.
",32,2,1,2,Fry,FryFry," The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to.  But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
",299,2,1,2,Leela,LeelaLeela," Fry, look. . It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.
",79,2,1,2,Fry,FarmerFarmer," Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
",76,2,1,2,Leela,FryFry," It's Amy! We're saved!
",24,2,1,2,Farmer,LeelaLeela," Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
",59,2,1,2,Fry,BenderBender," Not the magnet! No! No! No--  Uh-oh!
",38,2,1,2,Leela,BenderBender,"  She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,
She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes--
 I'll kill you Amy!
 She'll be comin' round the mountain,
She'll be comin' round the mountain,
She'll be comin'--
",221,2,1,2,Bender,FarmerFarmer," Aw, dang it!
",14,2,1,2,Bender,BenderBender,"  She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,
She'll be riding six white horses when she comes--
 Hey, I'm pretty good!
 She'll be riding six white horses...
",164,2,1,2,Farmer,LeelaLeela,"  So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?
",77,2,1,2,Bender,FryFry,"  Well ... close enough!
