",7,1,1,1,Leela,Leela33,Leela," Is it about my eye?
",21,1,1,1,Fry,Fry34,Fry," Sort of.
",10,1,1,1,Leela,Leela35,Leela," Just ask the question.
",24,1,1,1,Fry,Fry36,Fry," What's with the eye?
",22,1,1,1,Leela,Leela37,Leela," I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.
",52,1,1,1,Fry,Fry38,Fry," Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?

",26,1,1,1,Leela,Leela43,Leela," I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
",47,1,1,1,Fry,Fry44,Fry," Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.

",19,1,1,1,Leela,Leela56,Leela," Then you'll be fired--

",62,1,1,1,Bender,Fry79,Fry," Help! What's happening?
",25,1,1,1,Bender,Booth Voice80,Booth Voice," You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008.

",17,1,1,1,Terry,Ipgee85,Ipgee," This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.
",79,1,1,1,Leela,Leela86,Leela," Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.
",104,1,1,1,Ipgee,Ipgee87,Ipgee," Well that's your job, whether you like it or not. And it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not, which I do, very much! Now get to work!  Life is good!
",172,1,1,1,Leela,Fry88,Fry," Why would a robot need to drink?
",34,1,1,1,Ipgee,Bender89,Bender," I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want!  So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
",120,1,1,1,Fry,Fry90,Fry," Really? What do you do, Bender?
",33,1,1,1,Bender,Bender91,Bender," I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
",64,1,1,1,Fry,Fry92,Fry," You any good at it?
",21,1,1,1,Bender,Bender93,Bender," You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it!  31.  But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
",179,1,1,1,Fry,Fry94,Fry," What?
",7,1,1,1,Bender,Bender95,Bender," Suicide booths!  Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
",86,1,1,1,Fry,Fry96,Fry," Wait! You're the only friend I have!
",38,1,1,1,Bender,Bender97,Bender," You really want a robot for a friend?
",39,1,1,1,Fry,Fry98,Fry," Yeah, ever since I was six.
",29,1,1,1,Bender,Bender99,Bender," Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.

",20,1,1,1,URL,Fry128,Fry," Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.
",90,1,1,1,Bender,Bender129,Bender," Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
",111,1,1,1,Fry,Fry130,Fry," Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
",103,1,1,1,Bender,Bender131,Bender," I'll have to check my program ... yep.
",40,1,1,1,Fry,Leela132,Leela,"  Open up!
",11,1,1,1,Bender,Fry133,Fry," C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.

",65,1,1,1,Fry,Fry135,Fry," Come on, Bender! You can do it.
",33,1,1,1,Bender,Bender136,Bender," Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
",38,1,1,1,Fry,Fry137,Fry," Yes!
",6,1,1,1,Bender,Bender138,Bender," You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!
",107,1,1,1,Fry,Fry139,Fry," I don't know how you did that.
",32,1,1,1,Bender,Leela140,Leela," Wait!
",7,1,1,1,Fry,Bender141,Bender,"  No, thanks.
",14,1,1,1,Leela,Bender142,Bender," Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.

",69,1,1,1,Bender,Bender146,Bender," Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!
",29,1,1,1,Fry,Fry147,Fry," This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
",63,1,1,1,Bender,Fry148,Fry," My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
",66,1,1,1,Fry,Bender149,Bender," Wait! There's someone you know!
",33,1,1,1,Fry,Fry150,Fry," Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
",61,1,1,1,Bender,Leela151,Leela," Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
",71,1,1,1,Fry,Fry152,Fry," No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--
",46,1,1,1,Leela,Bender153,Bender," No friends.
",13,1,1,1,Fry,Fry154,Fry," My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
",90,1,1,1,Bender,Leela155,Leela," I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
",187,1,1,1,Fry,Fry156,Fry," Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it.  Your chip. What are you doing?
",172,1,1,1,Leela,Leela157,Leela," Quitting.
",11,1,1,1,Fry,Fry158,Fry," Why?
",6,1,1,1,Leela,Leela159,Leela," Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
",75,1,1,1,Fry,Fry160,Fry," What is the matter with you?
",30,1,1,1,Leela,Bender161,Bender," I just wanted to be part of the moment.
",41,1,1,1,Fry,Leela162,Leela," Hey! He stole my ring!
",24,1,1,1,Bender,Bender163,Bender," Sorry.  Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
",84,1,1,1,Leela,Leela164,Leela," I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
",108,1,1,1,Bender,Fry165,Fry," Correction: We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.

",14,1,1,1,Clark,Fry168,Fry," I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
",30,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth169,Farnsworth," I don't have an Uncle Fry.

",58,1,1,1,Bender,Bender172,Bender," Can we have some money?

",13,1,1,1,Bender,Farnsworth174,Farnsworth," Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship!  And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
",169,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Fry175,Fry," Whoa! A real live spaceship!
",30,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth176,Farnsworth," I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
",85,1,1,1,Fry,Smitty177,Smitty,"  Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.
",91,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Fry178,Fry," No!
",5,1,1,1,Smitty,Nixon179,Nixon," Get those bums!
",17,1,1,1,Fry,Bender180,Bender," Well, we're boned!
",20,1,1,1,Nixon,Leela181,Leela," Can't we get away in the ship?
",32,1,1,1,Bender,Farnsworth182,Farnsworth," I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
",74,1,1,1,Leela,Fry183,Fry," I'll get us out of here.

",12,1,1,1,Leela,Nixon198,Nixon," Fire! Fire!
",13,1,1,1,Fry,Smitty199,Smitty," I can't see nothing. Pretty though!
",37,1,1,1,Nixon,Fry200,Fry," So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
",56,1,1,1,Smitty,Farnsworth201,Farnsworth," Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?
",94,1,1,1,Fry,Bender202,Bender," New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
",44,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth203,Farnsworth," Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
",112,1,1,1,Bender,Fry204,Fry," Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
",54,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Leela205,Leela," Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
",77,1,1,1,Fry,Farnsworth206,Farnsworth," Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew.
",94,1,1,1,Leela,Fry207,Fry," This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
",102,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth208,Farnsworth," If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.
",111,1,1,1,Fry,Fry209,Fry," Cool! What's my job gonna be?
",31,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth210,Farnsworth," You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
",78,1,1,1,Fry,Fry211,Fry," So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?
",34,1,1,1,Farnsworth,Farnsworth212,Farnsworth," Exactly!
",10,1,1,1,Fry,Fry213,Fry," Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
