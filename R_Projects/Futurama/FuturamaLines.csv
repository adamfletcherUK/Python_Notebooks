",1,1,1
"27","(03:53) ⨂Leela: Good afternoon, sir. [Fry is impressed with what he sees. Leela turns around. She has one huge eye in the middle of her face. Fry screams.] Name?
",1,1,1
"28","(03:59) ⨂Fry: Uh, Fry.
",1,1,1
"29","(04:01) ⨂Leela: I'm Leela. Now, it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here.
",1,1,1

",1,1,1
"31","(04:07) ⨂Leela: As long as it's not about my eye.
",1,1,1

",1,1,1

",1,1,1
"34","(04:11) ⨂Fry: Sort of.
",1,1,1
"35","(04:13) ⨂Leela: Just ask the question.
",1,1,1
"36","(04:15) ⨂Fry: What's with the eye?
",1,1,1
"37","(04:16) ⨂Leela: I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject.
",1,1,1
"38","(04:19) ⨂Fry: Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?
",1,1,1
"39","(04:22) ⨂Leela: No, I just work here.
",1,1,1
"40","(04:27) ⨂Fry: Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
",1,1,1
"41","(04:30) ⨂Leela: Yep. It's December 31st, 2999.
",1,1,1
"42","(04:33) ⨂Fry: My God! A million years!
",1,1,1
"43","(04:37) ⨂Leela: I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
",1,1,1
"44","(04:39) ⨂Fry: Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
",1,1,1
"45","(04:52) ⨂Leela: Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.
",1,1,1
"46","(05:06) ⨂Leela: Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great-great-great-great-great-great-great...

",1,1,1
"51","(05:21) ⨂Fry: Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser. [A buzzer buzzes.] What's that?
",1,1,1
"52","(05:30) ⨂Leela: Your permanent career assignment.
",1,1,1
"53","(05:33) ⨂Fry: Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
",1,1,1
"54","(05:37) ⨂Leela: Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
",1,1,1
"55","(05:41) ⨂Fry: What if I refuse?
",1,1,1
"56","(05:43) ⨂Leela: Then you'll be fired--
",1,1,1
"57","(05:44) ⨂Fry: Fine!
",1,1,1
"58","(05:45) ⨂Leela: Out of a cannon into the Sun!
",1,1,1
"59","(05:47) ⨂Fry: But I don't like being a delivery boy.
",1,1,1
"60","(05:49) ⨂Leela: Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. [She points at a poster of a man wearing a hardhat with the caption ""You Gotta Do What You Gotta Do"".] You gotta do what you gotta do. Now hold out your hand. I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
",1,1,1
"61","(06:03) ⨂Fry: Keep that thing away from me!
",1,1,1
"62","(06:11) ⨂Leela: Hold still, dammit. I don't have good depth perception! [She jumps at Fry, misses, and falls into a cryogenic freezer. It sets itself for 1000 years.] You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One--
",1,1,1
"63","(06:25) ⨂Fry: See you in a thousand years! [He starts to walk out but hesitates. He walks back and changes the freeze time to five minutes.] You owe me one.
",1,1,1

"68","(07:38) ⨂Man #2: Pft! Tourist!
",1,1,1
"69","(07:45) ⨂Fry: Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. [An impatient robot joins the queue behind him. It is more or less human-shaped, grey, with an antenna on top of its head.] Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
",1,1,1
"70","(07:57) ⨂Bender: Bite my shiny metal ass.
",1,1,1
"71","(07:59) ⨂Fry: It doesn't look so shiny to me.
",1,1,1
"72","(08:01) ⨂Bender: Shinier than yours, meatbag!
",1,1,1
"73","(08:21) ⨂Bender: Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a two-fer!
",1,1,1
"74","(08:28) ⨂Booth Voice: Please select mode of death: ""Quick and Painless"" or ""Slow and Horrible"".
",1,1,1
"75","(08:34) ⨂Fry: Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call.
",1,1,1
"76","(08:36) ⨂Booth Voice: You have selected: ""Slow and Horrible"".
",1,1,1
"77","(08:39) ⨂Bender: Great choice! [Knives, tasers and Jacob's Ladders come out from behind a hatch.] Bring it on, baby!
",1,1,1
"78","(08:50) ⨂Bender: C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!
",1,1,1
"79","(08:55) ⨂Fry: Help! What's happening?
",1,1,1
"80","(09:02) ⨂Booth Voice: You are now dead. Thank you for using Stop-N-Drop, America's favourite suicide booth since 2008.
",1,1,1
"81","(09:10) ⨂Bender: Lousy, stinking rip-off! [He kicks the booth.] Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!
",1,1,1
"82","(09:22) ⨂Leela: Two, three-- Hey!
",1,1,1
"83","(09:25) ⨂Terry: [melodramatically] Welcome to the world of tomorrow!
",1,1,1
"84","(09:28) ⨂Leela: Shut up, Terry.
",1,1,1
"85","(09:30) ⨂Ipgee: This is unacceptable, Leela. You must find this Mr. Fry and install his chip.
",1,1,1
"86","(09:35) ⨂Leela: Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him.
",1,1,1
"87","(09:40) ⨂Ipgee: Well that's your job, whether you like it or not. And it's my job to make you do your job whether I like it or not, which I do, very much! Now get to work! [Leela leaves. He puts his feet up on the desk.] Life is good!
",1,1,1
"88","(10:02) ⨂Fry: Why would a robot need to drink?
",1,1,1
"89","(10:04) ⨂Bender: I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want! [He belches fire.] So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job.
",1,1,1
"90","(10:14) ⨂Fry: Really? What do you do, Bender?
",1,1,1
"91","(10:16) ⨂Bender: I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do.
",1,1,1
"92","(10:19) ⨂Fry: You any good at it?
",1,1,1
"93","(10:21) ⨂Bender: You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle: 30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! [unsure] 31. [normal] But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for.
",1,1,1
"94","(10:35) ⨂Fry: What?
",1,1,1
"95","(10:36) ⨂Bender: Suicide booths! [He finishes his drink and swallows the bottle.] Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself.
",1,1,1
"96","(10:43) ⨂Fry: Wait! You're the only friend I have!
",1,1,1
"97","(10:46) ⨂Bender: You really want a robot for a friend?
",1,1,1
"98","(10:49) ⨂Fry: Yeah, ever since I was six.
",1,1,1
"99","(10:51) ⨂Bender: Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger.
",1,1,1
"100","(10:59) ⨂Fry: Oh, no, it's the Cyclops! [He crouches down behind Bender.] Don't look! Don't look!
",1,1,1
"101","(11:03) ⨂Bender: I'm not looking!
",1,1,1
"102","(11:11) ⨂Leela: This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
",1,1,1
"103","(11:15) ⨂Smitty: We'll be there in five minutes.
",1,1,1
"104","(11:20) ⨂Bender: We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays!

"105","(11:29) ⨂Nimoy: Welcome to the Head Museum. I'm Leonard Nimoy.
",1,1,1
"106","(11:33) ⨂Fry: Spock? Hey! Hey... Do the thing!
",1,1,1
"107","(11:36) ⨂Nimoy: I don't do that anymore.
",1,1,1
"108","(11:38) ⨂Fry: This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
",1,1,1
"109","(11:42) ⨂Nimoy: We share our wisdom with those who seek it. It's a life of quiet dignity.
",1,1,1
"110","(11:47) ⨂Woman: Feeding time!
",1,1,1
"111","(11:58) ⨂Leela: Hmm. [She looks around and sees Fry and Bender hiding behind a shelf in amongst other assorted heads.] I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip.
",1,1,1
"112","(12:10) ⨂Fry: Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?
",1,1,1
"113","(12:12) ⨂Leela: It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do! [Fry backs away and hits a shelf with the heads of US presidents on it.] Watch it!
",1,1,1
"114","(12:22) ⨂Nixon: That's it! You just made my list!
",1,1,1
"115","(12:26) ⨂Fry: Ow! Stop it! Down, boy! Bad president!

",1,1,1
"119","(12:45) ⨂URL: Let us handle this, weird-y.
",1,1,1
"120","(12:49) ⨂Leela: Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages.
",1,1,1
"121","(12:53) ⨂Smitty: Keep your big nose out of this, eyeball!
",1,1,1
"122","(12:56) ⨂Leela: No-one makes fun of my nose.
",1,1,1
"123","(13:09) ⨂URL: Damn!
",1,1,1
"124","(13:10) ⨂Leela: You guys were totally out of control.
",1,1,1
"125","(13:12) ⨂Smitty: It's our job. We're peace officers.
",1,1,1
"126","(13:15) ⨂URL: Yeah, you know the law: You gotta do what you gotta do.
",1,1,1
"127","(13:22) ⨂Bender: Oh, we're trapped!
",1,1,1
"128","(13:27) ⨂Fry: Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars.
",1,1,1
"129","(13:32) ⨂Bender: Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?
",1,1,1
"130","(13:38) ⨂Fry: Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
",1,1,1
"131","(13:43) ⨂Bender: I'll have to check my program ... yep.
",1,1,1
"132","(13:46) ⨂Leela: [from outside] Open up!
",1,1,1
"133","(13:48) ⨂Fry: C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots.
",1,1,1
"134","(13:56) ⨂Bender: You're full of crap, Fry! [He turns and a dangling wire catches on his antenna and electrocutes him.] You make a persuasive argument, Fry.
",1,1,1
"135","(14:09) ⨂Fry: Come on, Bender! You can do it.
",1,1,1
"136","(14:11) ⨂Bender: Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
",1,1,1
"137","(14:16) ⨂Fry: Yes!
",1,1,1
"138","(14:18) ⨂Bender: You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!
",1,1,1
"139","(14:36) ⨂Fry: I don't know how you did that.
",1,1,1
"140","(14:44) ⨂Leela: Wait!
",1,1,1
"141","(14:45) ⨂Bender: [shouting] No, thanks.
",1,1,1
"142","(14:51) ⨂Bender: Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
",1,1,1
"143","(15:05) ⨂Fry: Good Lord! What is this?
",1,1,1
"144","(15:08) ⨂Bender: It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!
",1,1,1
"145","(15:15) ⨂Fry: It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories.
",1,1,1
"146","(15:20) ⨂Bender: Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!
",1,1,1
"147","(15:23) ⨂Fry: This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
",1,1,1
"148","(15:35) ⨂Fry: My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
",1,1,1
"149","(15:40) ⨂Bender: Wait! There's someone you know!
",1,1,1
"150","(15:43) ⨂Fry: Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already.
",1,1,1
"151","(15:47) ⨂Leela: Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel.
",1,1,1
"152","(15:52) ⨂Fry: No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--
",1,1,1
"153","(15:55) ⨂Bender: No friends.
",1,1,1
"154","(15:56) ⨂Fry: My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
",1,1,1
"155","(16:02) ⨂Leela: I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
",1,1,1
"156","(16:17) ⨂Fry: Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it. [He holds out his hand to Leela. She gets the implant gun ready. Fry cringes and looks away. The gun clicks but Fry feels nothing. He opens his eyes and sees Leela drop her own chip on the floor.] Your chip. What are you doing?
",1,1,1
"157","(16:37) ⨂Leela: Quitting.
",1,1,1
"158","(16:38) ⨂Fry: Why?
",1,1,1
"159","(16:39) ⨂Leela: Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
",1,1,1
"160","(16:48) ⨂Fry: What is the matter with you?
",1,1,1
"161","(16:51) ⨂Bender: I just wanted to be part of the moment.
",1,1,1
"162","(16:53) ⨂Leela: Hey! He stole my ring!
",1,1,1
"163","(16:55) ⨂Bender: Sorry. [He hands Leela's ring back.] Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink.
",1,1,1
"164","(17:03) ⨂Leela: I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
",1,1,1
"165","(17:09) ⨂Fry: Correction: We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
",1,1,1
"166","(17:18) ⨂Clark: [on TV] Hello, I'm Dick Clark's head. Welcome to a special year 3000 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve!

",1,1,1
"168","(17:31) ⨂Fry: I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
",1,1,1
"169","(17:33) ⨂Farnsworth: I don't have an Uncle Fry.
",1,1,1
"170","(17:35) ⨂Bender: You do now!
",1,1,1
"171","(17:40) ⨂Farnsworth: By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!
",1,1,1
"172","(17:45) ⨂Bender: Can we have some money?
",1,1,1
"173","(17:47) ⨂Farnsworth: Oh, my, no.
",1,1,1
"174","(17:50) ⨂Farnsworth: Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! [He points in the general direction of a big green spaceship in a huge hangar next to the lab.] And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
",1,1,1
"175","(18:02) ⨂Fry: Whoa! A real live spaceship!
",1,1,1
"176","(18:05) ⨂Farnsworth: I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
",1,1,1
"177","(18:12) ⨂Smitty: [from outside] Attention, job deserters! Come out with your hands up. We have you partially surrounded.
",1,1,1

",1,1,1
"180","(18:22) ⨂Bender: Well, we're boned!
",1,1,1
"181","(18:24) ⨂Leela: Can't we get away in the ship?
",1,1,1
"182","(18:26) ⨂Farnsworth: I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
",1,1,1
"183","(18:37) ⨂Fry: I'll get us out of here.
",1,1,1
"184","(18:44) ⨂Farnsworth: Can anyone drive stick?
",1,1,1
"185","(18:46) ⨂Leela: I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.

"186","(18:57) ⨂URL: If they try to take off, give 'em an ass-ful of laser.

"200","(19:44) ⨂Fry: So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever.
",1,1,1
"201","(19:47) ⨂Farnsworth: Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?
",1,1,1
"202","(19:54) ⨂Bender: New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
",1,1,1
"203","(19:57) ⨂Farnsworth: Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
",1,1,1
"204","(20:03) ⨂Fry: Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
",1,1,1
"205","(20:08) ⨂Leela: Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips.
",1,1,1
"206","(20:12) ⨂Farnsworth: Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew.

"207","(20:20) ⨂Fry: This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
",1,1,1
"208","(20:26) ⨂Farnsworth: If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.

"209","(20:34) ⨂Fry: Cool! What's my job gonna be?
",1,1,1
"210","(20:36) ⨂Farnsworth: You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.

"227","(00:58) ⨂Farnsworth: No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs.
",2,1,2
"228","(01:47) ⨂Fry: I'm never going to get used to the 31st century. [He points to his breakfast.] Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
",2,1,2
"229","(01:54) ⨂Leela: Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula.

",2,1,2
"234","(02:22) ⨂Farnsworth: Hmm, you!

",2,1,2
"244","(02:48) ⨂Farnsworth: Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual. [whispering] He wears sandals!
",2,1,2
"245","(03:01) ⨂Fry: Hi--
",2,1,2
"246","(03:02) ⨂Farnsworth: Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical.
",2,1,2
"247","(03:06) ⨂Zoidberg: Excellent, excellent!
",2,1,2
"248","(03:11) ⨂Farnsworth: You'll be fine.
",2,1,2
"249","(03:15) ⨂Zoidberg: Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain. [Fry opens his mouth.] No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!
",2,1,2

",2,1,2
"251","(03:22) ⨂Zoidberg: Really?
",2,1,2
"252","(03:24) ⨂Fry: Uh, is there a human doctor around?
",2,1,2
"253","(03:26) ⨂Zoidberg: Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say... [He makes a weird noise. Fry clears his throat and tries to imitate him but fails.] What? My mother was a saint! Get out!
",2,1,2
"254","(03:45) ⨂Farnsworth: Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy.
",2,1,2
"255","(03:47) ⨂Bender: Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!
",2,1,2
"256","(03:50) ⨂Farnsworth: Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?
",2,1,2
"257","(03:54) ⨂Amy: OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
",2,1,2
"258","(03:57) ⨂Leela: Ow!
",2,1,2
"259","(03:58) ⨂Bender: A little.
",2,1,2
"260","(03:59) ⨂Fry: Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?
",2,1,2
"261","(04:03) ⨂Farnsworth: As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. [whispering] I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me.
",2,1,2
"262","(04:14) ⨂Amy: Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?
",2,1,2
"263","(04:19) ⨂Fry: [chuffed] Last time I checked.
",2,1,2
"264","(04:20) ⨂Leela: Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
",2,1,2
"265","(04:23) ⨂Amy: Look, we're not as rich as everybody says.
",2,1,2
"266","(04:26) ⨂Leela: Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
",2,1,2
"267","(04:28) ⨂Amy: [ashamed] Kappa Kappa Wong.
",2,1,2
"268","(04:30) ⨂Bender: Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. [His body reaches into Amy's back pocket, takes out her wallet and empties the money into his neck.] [singing] Look at my head. It's all painted! Look at my head! I got a big, old head, hey! Ho! [His body replaces the wallet and signals an all clear] [talking] Alright, show's over, I'm tired.
",2,1,2
"269","(04:44) ⨂Farnsworth: Ah, to be young again. And also a robot. Now, as I recall, you youngsters have a package to deliver.
",2,1,2
"270","(04:51) ⨂Fry: Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!
",2,1,2
"271","(04:57) ⨂Bender: Nice catch, idiot!
",2,1,2
"272","(05:04) ⨂Fry: So where are we going anyway?
",2,1,2
"273","(05:05) ⨂Leela: Nowhere special. The moon.
",2,1,2
"274","(05:07) ⨂Fry: The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
",2,1,2
"275","(05:15) ⨂Amy: Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?
",2,1,2
"276","(05:18) ⨂Leela: Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
",2,1,2
"277","(05:25) ⨂Farnsworth: Nothing will go wrong. [He leans over to Leela.] [whispering] If something goes wrong, bring back the blood.
",2,1,2
"278","(05:37) ⨂Fry: Can I do the countdown?
",2,1,2
"279","(05:39) ⨂Leela: Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out.
",2,1,2
"280","(05:41) ⨂Fry: Ten ... [The ship takes off, clears the atmosphere and approaches the moon.] ... nine--
",2,1,2
"281","(05:43) ⨂Leela: OK, we're here!

"282","(05:44) ⨂Fry: [awestruck] Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!

"283","(05:55) ⨂Fry: Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
",2,1,2
"284","(05:57) ⨂Leela: Relax. It's open till 9.
",2,1,2
"285","(05:59) ⨂Fry: That's one small step for Fry--
",2,1,2
"286","(06:02) ⨂Man: And one giant line for admission!
",2,1,2
"287","(06:06) ⨂Fry: Wow! [He turns to the man.] Um, can I have cuts?
",2,1,2
"288","(06:09) ⨂Man: Hmm ... no!
",2,1,2
"289","(06:16) ⨂Fry: You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
",2,1,2
"290","(06:20) ⨂Amy: Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
",2,1,2
"291","(06:23) ⨂Fry: Let's go, already!
",2,1,2
"292","(06:24) ⨂Leela: Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
",2,1,2
"293","(06:27) ⨂Fry: Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
",2,1,2
"294","(06:29) ⨂Bender: Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
",2,1,2
"295","(06:32) ⨂Leela: OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--
",2,1,2
"296","(06:35) ⨂Fry: I had more but you go ahead.
",2,1,2
"297","(06:37) ⨂Leela: We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
",2,1,2
"298","(06:40) ⨂Fry: But I've never been to the moon before.
",2,1,2
"299","(06:43) ⨂Leela: Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. [The other three high-five.] Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful.
",2,1,2
"300","(06:56) ⨂Amy: Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir-- Um, ma'am!
",2,1,2
"301","(07:02) ⨂Amy: Clear?
",2,1,2
"302","(07:03) ⨂Fry: Clear!

"308","(07:23) ⨂Sal: Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
",2,1,2
"309","(07:27) ⨂Fry: But you are lazy, right?
",2,1,2
"310","(07:28) ⨂Sal: Oh, don't get me started.
",2,1,2
"311","(07:43) ⨂Craterface: Hi, I'm Craterface! Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir.
",2,1,2
"312","(07:50) ⨂Bender: Better mascots than you have tried.
",2,1,2
"313","(07:56) ⨂Craterface: At least I still have my self respect!
",2,1,2
"314","(08:10) ⨂Leela: Who buys this trash?
",2,1,2
"315","(08:11) ⨂Bender: Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
",2,1,2
"316","(08:15) ⨂Fry: Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets.
",2,1,2
"317","(08:19) ⨂Bender: Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh! [He starts singing his own version of Bob Dylan's ""Blowin' in the Wind"".] [singing] How many roads must a man walk down, before you-- [He howls. Fry takes the magnet off and Bender gasps.] [talking] Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!
",2,1,2
"318","(08:37) ⨂Fry: So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
",2,1,2
"319","(08:40) ⨂Bender: Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
",2,1,2
"320","(08:48) ⨂Whalerbots: [singing] We're whalers on the moon,
We carry a harpoon,
But there ain't no whales,
So we tell our tall tale,
And sing our whaling tune!

"321","(08:57) ⨂Whalerbot: Bender, hey, Bender! Over here!
",2,1,2
"322","(08:59) ⨂Bender: Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!
",2,1,2
"323","(09:03) ⨂Announcer: Monsanto presents: The Goophy Gopher Revue!

"324","(09:07) ⨂Gopher #1: Why does a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock?
",2,1,2
"325","(09:11) ⨂Gopher #2: Because it's a little meteor!
",2,1,2
"326","(09:18) ⨂Fry: This is weak!
",2,1,2
"327","(09:20) ⨂Gopher #1: Address all complaints to the Monsanto corporation.
",2,1,2
"328","(09:25) ⨂Leela: What's wrong, Fry?
",2,1,2
"329","(09:26) ⨂Fry: I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth. [He tosses his candy floss into a bin and runs to a window.] That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!
",2,1,2
"330","(09:42) ⨂Leela: But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
",2,1,2
"331","(09:45) ⨂Bender: Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
",2,1,2
"332","(09:50) ⨂Leela: Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
",2,1,2
"333","(09:59) ⨂Fry: I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
",2,1,2
"334","(10:02) ⨂Bender: [shouting] Next year in Jerusalem!
",2,1,2
"335","(10:07) ⨂Fry: Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
",2,1,2
"336","(10:13) ⨂Narrator: [on loudspeaker] The story of lunar exploration started with one man. A man with a dream.
",2,1,2
"337","(10:19) ⨂Ralph Kramden-bot: One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon!
",2,1,2
"338","(10:26) ⨂Leela: Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!
",2,1,2
"339","(10:30) ⨂Fry: That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
",2,1,2
"340","(10:42) ⨂Amy: Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball! [Bender taps her on the shoulder.] Hm?
",2,1,2
"341","(10:46) ⨂Bender: Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer.
",2,1,2
"342","(10:52) ⨂Amy: The keys to the ship! [She pats her pockets.] They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
",2,1,2
"343","(10:58) ⨂Bender: Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
",2,1,2
"344","(11:01) ⨂Amy: Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
",2,1,2
"345","(11:03) ⨂Sal: What do I look like? A guy who's not lazy?
",2,1,2
"346","(11:18) ⨂Narrator: [on loudspeaker] No one knows where, when or how Man first landed on the moon.
",2,1,2
"347","(11:22) ⨂Fry: I do.
",2,1,2
"348","(11:23) ⨂Narrator: [on loudspeaker] But our fun-gineers think it might have happened something like this:

",2,1,2
"350","(11:30) ⨂Gophers: [singing] We carry a harpoon,

",2,1,2
"352","(11:36) ⨂Leela: [singing] And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
",2,1,2
"353","(11:37) ⨂Fry: That's not how it happened.
",2,1,2
"354","(11:40) ⨂Leela: Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!
",2,1,2
"355","(11:42) ⨂Fry: This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
",2,1,2
"356","(11:45) ⨂Leela: Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track.
",2,1,2
"357","(11:51) ⨂Fry: Not for long!
",2,1,2
"358","(11:56) ⨂Whalerbot: Ooh! Ah! I died doin' what I loved.
",2,1,2
"359","(12:01) ⨂Leela: OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?
",2,1,2
"360","(12:09) ⨂Fry: Agreed. [He drives over craters and flies through the air, cheering.] Yeah! Crank up the radio!
",2,1,2
"361","(12:15) ⨂Whalerbots: [singing; on radio] We're whalers on the--
",2,1,2
"362","(12:18) ⨂Fry: Yee-haw!
",2,1,2
"363","(12:22) ⨂Leela: Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
",2,1,2
"364","(12:25) ⨂Fry: No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?
",2,1,2
"365","(12:28) ⨂Leela: That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
",2,1,2
"366","(12:31) ⨂Fry: Well I'm feelin' lucky! [The car suddenly falls into a huge crater and starts to sink at the bottom.] Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
",2,1,2
"367","(12:43) ⨂Fry: We're gonna die! It's every man for himself! [He jumps off the car and starts to sink.] Help me, Leela! [Leela grabs Fry and an oxygen canister and flies out of the crater.] You did it! We're safe!
",2,1,2
"368","(13:00) ⨂Leela: No. Now we're gonna die.
",2,1,2
"369","(13:03) ⨂Fry: It's every man for himself.
",2,1,2
"370","(13:09) ⨂Bender: Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!
",2,1,2
"371","(13:12) ⨂Amy: Shut up. You're distracting me.
",2,1,2
"372","(13:14) ⨂Bender: Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know: Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor.
",2,1,2
"373","(13:21) ⨂Amy: I know how to make love!
",2,1,2
"374","(13:24) ⨂Bender: Here, let me do it. [He puts his hand up the chute and grabs the keys but then drops them.] Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged! [Moon Patrol officers walk up behind him.] That's her, officers! [He points at Amy.] Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!
",2,1,2
"375","(13:44) ⨂Bender: Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!
",2,1,2
"376","(13:57) ⨂Fry: [gasping] I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there.
",2,1,2
"377","(14:11) ⨂Leela: Thank God!
",2,1,2
"378","(14:14) ⨂Hydroponic Farmer: Trespassers, eh?
",2,1,2
"379","(14:15) ⨂Fry: No, sir. We're amusement park patrons.
",2,1,2

",2,1,2
"381","(14:23) ⨂Leela: Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
",2,1,2
"382","(14:26) ⨂Farmer: Huh, borry? Looky here, city girl, oxygen don't grow on trees. You'll have to earn it doing chores on my hydroponic farm. You can go back to your precious theme park at sun up.

"383","(14:38) ⨂Fry: I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
",2,1,2
"384","(14:40) ⨂Leela: Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon.
",2,1,2
"385","(14:43) ⨂Farmer: Yup. Drops down to -173!
",2,1,2
"386","(14:46) ⨂Fry: Fahrenheit or Celsius?
",2,1,2
"387","(14:47) ⨂Farmer: First one, then th'other. And them spacesuits ain't a-heated so you ain't goin' nowhere till sunrise. You can sleep in the barn. Just don't be a-touchin' my three beautiful robot daughters. Y'hear?
",2,1,2
"388","(15:00) ⨂Fry: Robot daughters?
",2,1,2
"389","(15:02) ⨂Farmer: This here is Lulabelle 7.
",2,1,2
"390","(15:03) ⨂Lulabelle 7: Yoo-hoo!
",2,1,2
"391","(15:05) ⨂Farmer: Daisy-Mae 128K.
",2,1,2
"392","(15:07) ⨂Daisy-Mae 128K: Yoo-hoo!
",2,1,2
"393","(15:09) ⨂Farmer: And the Crushinator.
",2,1,2
"394","(15:12) ⨂Crushinator: [mechanical voice] Yoo-hoo.
",2,1,2
"395","(15:14) ⨂Fry: Whoa!
",2,1,2
"396","(15:15) ⨂Leela: I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon.
",2,1,2
"397","(15:22) ⨂Fry: And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
",2,1,2
"398","(15:31) ⨂Leela: Fry, face it: The moon is a dump. It's a boring, dried-up wasteland and the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?
",2,1,2
"399","(15:41) ⨂Fry: I guess I can't.
",2,1,2
"400","(15:46) ⨂Farmer: I'll learn ye to sleep with my robot daughters!
",2,1,2
"401","(15:49) ⨂Bender: He'll never find me in here.
",2,1,2
"402","(15:52) ⨂Leela: Bender?
",2,1,2
"403","(15:53) ⨂Fry: Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?
",2,1,2
"404","(15:57) ⨂Bender: Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
",2,1,2
"405","(16:12) ⨂Farmer: Oh, no you don't! C'mere, Crushinator.
",2,1,2
"406","(16:15) ⨂Crushinator: [mechanical voice] Yes, Pa.
",2,1,2
"407","(16:33) ⨂Fry: It's too low.
",2,1,2
"408","(16:34) ⨂Leela: Hang on. Hang on. Jump! [The trio jump over the bridge and the buggy drives under it. They land back in the car. The Crushinator slams into it and cuts her way through. They come to a gorge.] Hold on to your helmet!
",2,1,2
"409","(16:56) ⨂Farmer: God darn it, Crushinator, jump!
",2,1,2
"410","(16:59) ⨂Crushinator: [mechanical voice] No, Pa. I love him.
",2,1,2
"411","(17:07) ⨂Fry: Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!
",2,1,2
"412","(17:10) ⨂Leela: Nightfall's coming. [The shadow falls over Fry and he starts to shiver.] Hurry, before we freeze.
",2,1,2
"413","(17:15) ⨂Bender: What do you mean ""we"", mammal?
",2,1,2
"414","(17:24) ⨂Farnsworth: Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas.
",2,1,2
"415","(17:35) ⨂Leela: We can't outrun it forever.
",2,1,2
"416","(17:38) ⨂Fry: Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
",2,1,2
"417","(17:48) ⨂Leela: Quick, get in.
",2,1,2
"418","(17:51) ⨂Fry: It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint! [He stamps over it.] Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?
",2,1,2
"419","(18:02) ⨂Leela: Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust. [The shadow creeps over Fry and his smile fades.] Now get in here before you freeze.
",2,1,2
"420","(18:22) ⨂Bender: Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing.
",2,1,2
"421","(18:36) ⨂Leela: Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
",2,1,2
"422","(18:40) ⨂Fry: Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here.
",2,1,2
"423","(18:43) ⨂Leela: That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is.
",2,1,2
"424","(18:49) ⨂Fry: I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
",2,1,2
"425","(19:01) ⨂Leela: A week would be a little much.
",2,1,2
"426","(19:03) ⨂Fry: The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. [Leela's cold glance becomes a sympathetic frown.] But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to.
",2,1,2
"427","(19:25) ⨂Leela: Fry, look. [Fry and Leela gaze at a stunning Earthrise]. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before.
",2,1,2
"428","(19:42) ⨂Farmer: Had to come back for the Crushinator, eh, robot? Well I got you this time.
",2,1,2
"429","(19:56) ⨂Fry: It's Amy! We're saved!
",2,1,2
"430","(19:58) ⨂Leela: Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
",2,1,2
"431","(20:10) ⨂Bender: Not the magnet! No! No! No-- [The winch grabs him.] Uh-oh!
",2,1,2
"432","(20:17) ⨂Bender: [singing] She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes,
She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes--
[talking] I'll kill you Amy!
[singing] She'll be comin' round the mountain,
She'll be comin' round the mountain,
She'll be comin'--
",2,1,2
"433","(20:33) ⨂Farmer: Aw, dang it!
",2,1,2
"434","(20:41) ⨂Bender: [singing] She'll be riding six white horses when she comes,
She'll be riding six white horses when she comes--
[talking] Hey, I'm pretty good!
[singing] She'll be riding six white horses...
",2,1,2
"435","(20:50) ⨂Leela: [from lander] So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?
",2,1,2
"436","(20:55) ⨂Fry: [from lander] Well ... close enough!
",2,1,2
"437","(20:57) ⨂Bender: [singing; over credits] Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,
Oh, I'll shoot her with my ray gun,
Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes,
When she comes!
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans, 
I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,
In the world!
[shouting] One more time!

"438","(00:39) ⨂Bender: Hey!
",3,1,3
"439","(00:44) ⨂Hermes: Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work.
",3,1,3
"440","(00:48) ⨂Fry: I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
",3,1,3
"441","(00:54) ⨂Hermes: Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one, then race forward--
",3,1,3
"442","(01:08) ⨂Hermes: Concerning our pest problem: Somebody's been leaving food around and it's attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps. [A trap snaps and an owl hoots.] Now... [He flicks a button and a graph appears on the big screen. It is a straight line that inclines ever so slightly at the end.] As this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I'm appointing him head of a committee to find who's responsible. Fry? [Fry doesn't answer. He is taking a shower in the Emergency Chemical Burn Shower.] Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living here starting to get in the way of bus--
",3,1,3
"443","(01:49) ⨂Leela: What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
",3,1,3
"444","(01:53) ⨂Fry: [pointing to his hair] And great lift!
",3,1,3
"445","(01:55) ⨂Leela: Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
",3,1,3
"446","(01:58) ⨂Fry: Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything.
",3,1,3
"447","(02:03) ⨂Leela: Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry.
",3,1,3
"448","(02:05) ⨂Bender: That's right, we want some money— Wait. What's this about Fry?
",3,1,3
"449","(02:08) ⨂Leela: He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
",3,1,3
"450","(02:12) ⨂Farnsworth: Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. [He picks a small box and opens it. It is empty.] This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago.
",3,1,3
"451","(02:28) ⨂Fry: Hey, Professor, great jerky!
",3,1,3
"452","(02:33) ⨂Farnsworth: My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!
",3,1,3
"453","(02:42) ⨂Announcer: [voice-over; on TV] Bachelor Chow, now with flavour!
",3,1,3
"454","(02:45) ⨂Commentator: [voice-over; on TV] And Bigfoot is down!
",3,1,3
"455","(02:47) ⨂Fry: Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on.
",3,1,3
"456","(02:52) ⨂Announcer: [voice-over; on TV] All My Circuits is brought to you by Robo Fresh: Designed by a robot, for a robot.
",3,1,3
"457","(03:01) ⨂Calculon: [on TV] I've been processing this for some time, Monique, and, well, will you marry me?
",3,1,3
"458","(03:06) ⨂Monique: [on TV] Oh, Calculon! [They kiss. Calculon takes out a ring box, opens it, takes out a nut and screws it onto Monique's finger.] It fits! Then you must know that I'm--
",3,1,3
"459","(03:19) ⨂Calculon: [on TV] Metric? I've always known. But for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.
",3,1,3
"460","(03:29) ⨂Fry: Hmm, must be a friend of theirs.
",3,1,3
"461","(03:31) ⨂Bender: Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements.
",3,1,3
"462","(03:33) ⨂Leela: We've all talked it over and--
",3,1,3
"463","(03:35) ⨂Bender: Hey, All My Circuits! Move over.
",3,1,3
"464","(03:41) ⨂Leela: Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it.
",3,1,3
"465","(03:46) ⨂Fry: I know but I forgive you.
",3,1,3
"466","(03:48) ⨂Leela: No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office--
",3,1,3
"467","(03:51) ⨂Fry: Uh-huh.
",3,1,3
"468","(03:52) ⨂Leela: And by ""people"" I mean you!
",3,1,3
"469","(03:53) ⨂Fry: Right.
",3,1,3
"470","(03:54) ⨂Leela: And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean--
",3,1,3
"471","(03:56) ⨂Fry: Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
",3,1,3
"472","(03:58) ⨂Bender: Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
",3,1,3
"473","(04:03) ⨂Fry: So, who's that weird-looking guy?
",3,1,3
"474","(04:04) ⨂Bender: That's a human.
",3,1,3
"475","(04:05) ⨂Fry: What's he do?
",3,1,3
"476","(04:06) ⨂Bender: Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves.
",3,1,3
"477","(04:10) ⨂Fry: Boring!
",3,1,3
"478","(04:13) ⨂Human Friend: [on TV] Calculon? I thought you were in a coma.
",3,1,3
"479","(04:16) ⨂Calculon: [on TV] That's what I wanted you to think with your soft, human brain.
",3,1,3
"480","(04:21) ⨂Fry: Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?
",3,1,3
"481","(04:26) ⨂Hermes: We'll bill you for the couch.
",3,1,3
"482","(04:35) ⨂Bender: Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba.
",3,1,3
"483","(04:39) ⨂Fry: It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
",3,1,3
"484","(04:42) ⨂Bender: Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol. [He drinks a glass.] The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged.
",3,1,3
"485","(04:52) ⨂Fry: What are the cigars for?
",3,1,3
"486","(04:54) ⨂Bender: They make me look cool.
",3,1,3
"487","(04:56) ⨂Fry: I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
",3,1,3
"488","(05:00) ⨂Bender: Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk. [He points over his shoulder at a man.] That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?
",3,1,3
"489","(05:09) ⨂Fry: I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
",3,1,3
"490","(05:13) ⨂Bender: Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?
",3,1,3
"491","(05:17) ⨂Fry: Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
",3,1,3
"492","(05:21) ⨂Bender: Nah, I've always wanted a pet.
",3,1,3
"493","(05:33) ⨂Bender: Here we are. Your new home.
",3,1,3
"494","(05:34) ⨂Fry: Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before.
",3,1,3
"495","(05:38) ⨂Bender: Come on in, I'll give you the tour!
",3,1,3
"496","(05:53) ⨂Bender: Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space.
",3,1,3
"497","(06:04) ⨂Fry: It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
",3,1,3
"498","(06:07) ⨂Bender: Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night.
",3,1,3
"499","(06:16) ⨂Fry: Wait, Bender. Bender?
",3,1,3
"500","(06:21) ⨂Bender: [sleep-talking] Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
",3,1,3
"501","(06:27) ⨂Fry: Bender, wake up!
",3,1,3
"502","(06:30) ⨂Bender: I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
",3,1,3
"503","(06:35) ⨂Fry: Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?
",3,1,3
"504","(06:38) ⨂Bender: Bath what?
",3,1,3
"505","(06:39) ⨂Fry: Bathroom.
",3,1,3
"506","(06:40) ⨂Bender: What room?
",3,1,3
"507","(06:41) ⨂Fry: Bathroom!
",3,1,3
"508","(06:42) ⨂Bender: What what?
",3,1,3
"509","(06:43) ⨂Fry: Ah, never mind!
",3,1,3
"510","(06:49) ⨂Bender: [sleep-talking] Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?
",3,1,3
"511","(07:02) ⨂Leela: We sure are cheerful this morning.
",3,1,3
"512","(07:04) ⨂Bender: Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
",3,1,3
"513","(07:15) ⨂Leela: What happened to you?
",3,1,3
"514","(07:16) ⨂Fry: Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle? [Leela twists his neck back properly.] Now you're OK.
",3,1,3
"515","(07:25) ⨂Leela: Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
",3,1,3
"516","(07:29) ⨂Fry: [sexily] Is that an invitation?
",3,1,3
"517","(07:32) ⨂Leela: Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out.
",3,1,3
"518","(07:36) ⨂Fry: Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him.
",3,1,3
"519","(07:40) ⨂Bender: Hey, there's my little space heater.
",3,1,3
"520","(07:46) ⨂Fry: Well, I'm moving out!
",3,1,3
"521","(07:48) ⨂Bender: What?
",3,1,3
"522","(07:49) ⨂Fry: I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room.
",3,1,3
"523","(07:51) ⨂Bender: Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
",3,1,3
"524","(08:00) ⨂Leela: What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
",3,1,3
"525","(08:03) ⨂Bender: I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place. [He presses some buttons in his chest cabinet.] And now they're gone.
",3,1,3
"526","(08:13) ⨂Underwater house salesman: Sure, it ain't one of them la-de-da above-ground places. But if you like dank, hey, forget about it!
",3,1,3
"527","(08:21) ⨂Leela: At least it's got a great view.
",3,1,3
"528","(08:24) ⨂Bender: What the--?
",3,1,3
"529","(08:31) ⨂Underwater House Salesman: Excuse me. I gotta go change a lightbulb.
",3,1,3
"530","(08:38) ⨂Leela: Wow! Now this is fantastic!
",3,1,3
"531","(08:41) ⨂Fry: Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
",3,1,3
"532","(08:55) ⨂Fry: Well, I give up. What's the catch?
",3,1,3
"533","(08:57) ⨂Suspiciously fantastic apartment salesman: Oh, no catch. Although we 'are technically in New Jersey.
",3,1,3
"534","(09:01) ⨂Fry: Not one place even remotely liveable.
",3,1,3
"535","(09:04) ⨂Farnsworth: Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say. Very well then. [He hangs up.] Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mbutu.
",3,1,3
"536","(09:21) ⨂Leela: Was his apartment rent-controlled?
",3,1,3
"537","(09:29) ⨂Leela: Wow. This is beautiful.
",3,1,3
"538","(09:32) ⨂Bender: What's with all the crap?
",3,1,3
"539","(09:33) ⨂Leela: It's not crap.
",3,1,3
"540","(09:34) ⨂Hattie: Dr. Mbutu collected this crap while he was exploring the watcha-call-it ... universe!
",3,1,3
"541","(09:40) ⨂Fry: Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about: A TV.
",3,1,3
"542","(09:44) ⨂Hattie: It's got a TV, you young watcha-call-it ... idiot!
",3,1,3
"543","(09:49) ⨂Fry: Ooh!
",3,1,3
"544","(09:50) ⨂Bender: Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy. [Fry opens a closet and Bender walks inside.] Ah. I can barely move! [He closes the door.] (from inside) It's perfect!
",3,1,3
"545","(10:52) ⨂Fry: Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home.
",3,1,3
"546","(10:57) ⨂Bender: Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first.
",3,1,3
"547","(11:09) ⨂Hermes: Hey, mon!
",3,1,3
"548","(11:12) ⨂Leela: Happy housewarming, Fry! [Fry stares blankly at Leela's gift.] It's a miniature fruit salad tree.
",3,1,3
"549","(11:17) ⨂Fry: Ooh! [He takes off a miniature banana, peels it, eats it and tosses the skin on the floor. Amy slips over it and screams.] Hey, Amy!
",3,1,3
"550","(11:25) ⨂Amy: Hey!
",3,1,3
"551","(11:26) ⨂Farnsworth: This is for you, Fry [He hands Fry a small, gift-wrapped mummy.] Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style.
",3,1,3
"552","(11:33) ⨂Bender: Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd! [He belches fire.] I'd better go out for more beer.
",3,1,3
"553","(11:38) ⨂Fry: Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!
",3,1,3
"554","(11:42) ⨂Bender: I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained.
",3,1,3
"555","(11:54) ⨂Fry: Hey!
",3,1,3

"557","(12:02) ⨂Zoidberg: Thank you. I made them myself.
",3,1,3
"558","(12:07) ⨂Fry: Sh! The wedding's about to start!
",3,1,3
"559","(12:09) ⨂Preacherbot: [on TV] If anyone here objects to this union, let them speak now or forever hold their—
",3,1,3
"560","(12:17) ⨂Fry: Is he objecting or backing up?
",3,1,3
"561","(12:19) ⨂Amy: Looks like both.
",3,1,3
"562","(12:21) ⨂Calculon: [on TV] I'm afraid my half-brother is correct. You see, I have a terrible secret and that secret is--
",3,1,3
"563","(12:27) ⨂Amy: Oh, this isn't right.
",3,1,3
"564","(12:28) ⨂Hermes: Oh, come on!
",3,1,3
"565","(12:29) ⨂Farnsworth: Fix it!
",3,1,3
"566","(12:30) ⨂Bender: Hey, what happened to the TV?
",3,1,3
"567","(12:32) ⨂Fry: It just went out.
",3,1,3
"568","(12:33) ⨂Bender: This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
",3,1,3
"569","(12:38) ⨂Hermes: Alright!
",3,1,3
"570","(12:39) ⨂Fry: [shouting] Come back, Bender! It's working!
",3,1,3
"571","(12:41) ⨂Calculon: [on TV] To reiterate, my terrible secret is--
",3,1,3
"572","(12:47) ⨂Fry: It's out again.
",3,1,3
"573","(12:48) ⨂Bender: What? That's the last straw!
",3,1,3
"574","(12:51) ⨂Fry: It's back on!
",3,1,3
"575","(12:56) ⨂Hattie: Pardon me. I don't mean to pry into what you're doing in here with the crab and the one-eyed lady and the Chinese girl but everyone on this floor is having trouble with their TV reception.
",3,1,3
"576","(13:05) ⨂Bender: Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
",3,1,3
"577","(13:09) ⨂Hattie: Relax, sonny. This kajigger'll find the source of the interference.
",3,1,3
"578","(13:29) ⨂Tenant #1: What's going on?
",3,1,3
"579","(13:30) ⨂Tenant #2: We want our TV back!
",3,1,3
"580","(13:35) ⨂Hattie: There's your problem.
",3,1,3
"581","(13:37) ⨂Amy: Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!
",3,1,3
"582","(13:39) ⨂Randy: Then get rid of it!
",3,1,3
"583","(13:41) ⨂Tenant #1: Get out!
",3,1,3
"584","(13:42) ⨂Bender: You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
",3,1,3
"585","(13:46) ⨂Leela: You had cable. This is satellite.
",3,1,3
"586","(13:49) ⨂Farnsworth: Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
",3,1,3
"587","(13:52) ⨂Huge-assed woman: They're on my cell phone too.
",3,1,3
"588","(13:54) ⨂Bender: Madam, I believe you're mistaken!
",3,1,3
"589","(13:57) ⨂Bender: [thinking; on phone] Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!
",3,1,3
"590","(14:00) ⨂Bender: Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!
",3,1,3
"591","(14:04) ⨂Randy: The robot has to go!
",3,1,3
"592","(14:05) ⨂Tenant #1: Yeah.
",3,1,3
"593","(14:06) ⨂Tenant #3: Get him out of here!
",3,1,3
"594","(14:08) ⨂Hattie: Well, you heard the mob!
",3,1,3
"595","(14:09) ⨂Bender: Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?
",3,1,3
"596","(14:15) ⨂Fry: It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here.
",3,1,3
"597","(14:19) ⨂Bender: Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
",3,1,3
"598","(14:25) ⨂Fry: Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?
",3,1,3
"599","(14:30) ⨂Bender: I don't understand.
",3,1,3
"600","(14:32) ⨂Fry: Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?
",3,1,3
"601","(14:36) ⨂Bender: But, then we wouldn't be roommates.
",3,1,3
"602","(14:39) ⨂Fry: I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
",3,1,3
"603","(14:41) ⨂Hattie: No he can't.
",3,1,3
"604","(14:43) ⨂Fry: Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy.
",3,1,3
"605","(14:47) ⨂Bender: [downbeat] Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy.
",3,1,3
"606","(14:55) ⨂Randy: Hey, the TV's back on!
",3,1,3
"607","(14:58) ⨂Preacherbot: [on TV] We are gathered here to mourn the death of Calculon; industrialist, private eye, friend.
",3,1,3
"608","(15:04) ⨂Calculon: [on TV] Mind if I give the eulogy?
",3,1,3
"609","(15:08) ⨂Monique: [on TV] Calculon! You're alive!
",3,1,3
"610","(15:13) ⨂Randy: Calculon's back!
",3,1,3
"611","(15:16) ⨂Farnsworth: Right, so long.
",3,1,3
"612","(15:18) ⨂Zoidberg: Goodbye.
",3,1,3
"613","(15:19) ⨂Amy: [crying] Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
",3,1,3
"614","(15:23) ⨂Hermes: I don't know, Amy. I just don't know.
",3,1,3
"615","(15:24) ⨂Fry: Hey, thanks for coming.
",3,1,3
"616","(15:28) ⨂Leela: Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?
",3,1,3
"617","(15:32) ⨂Fry: Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs.
",3,1,3
"618","(15:35) ⨂Leela: Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
",3,1,3
"619","(15:39) ⨂Fry: Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
",3,1,3
"620","(15:43) ⨂Leela: Bender's not a guy, he's a robot.
",3,1,3
"621","(15:46) ⨂Fry: Same thing.
",3,1,3
"622","(15:51) ⨂Bender: It's so big and empty.
",3,1,3
"623","(15:56) ⨂Bender: My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes. [He takes out a beer from his chest cabinet.] Oh, what's the point?
",3,1,3
"624","(16:16) ⨂Leela: Bender? [He turns around and she gasps.] My God, you're a mess!
",3,1,3
"625","(16:22) ⨂Bender: Leave me alone!
",3,1,3
"626","(16:24) ⨂Leela: Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?
",3,1,3
"627","(16:29) ⨂Bender: Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
",3,1,3
"628","(16:32) ⨂Leela: Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you.
",3,1,3
"629","(16:37) ⨂Bender: I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
",3,1,3
"630","(16:41) ⨂Leela: Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this.
",3,1,3
"631","(16:46) ⨂Bender: Like how? Having my antenna removed?
",3,1,3
"632","(16:49) ⨂Leela: Well, if that would work.
",3,1,3
"633","(16:51) ⨂Bender: Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
",3,1,3
"634","(17:03) ⨂Leela: Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
",3,1,3
"635","(17:10) ⨂Bender: I promise nothing!
",3,1,3
"636","(17:50) ⨂Fry: What up?
",3,1,3
"637","(17:51) ⨂Leela: I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
",3,1,3
"638","(17:54) ⨂Fry: Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
",3,1,3
"639","(17:57) ⨂Leela: Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
",3,1,3
"640","(18:03) ⨂Fry: Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
",3,1,3
"641","(18:06) ⨂Leela: He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him.
",3,1,3
"642","(18:11) ⨂Fry: Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him.
",3,1,3
"643","(18:16) ⨂Fry: Oh, stupid TV! [Enter Bender.] Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!
",3,1,3
"644","(18:23) ⨂Bender: That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
",3,1,3
"645","(18:27) ⨂Fry: Don't do it!
",3,1,3
"646","(18:28) ⨂Bender: I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again.
",3,1,3
"647","(18:39) ⨂Leela: Bender! Stop!
",3,1,3
"648","(18:40) ⨂Fry: Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
",3,1,3
"649","(18:42) ⨂Bender: No, I'm going to chop off my antenna.
",3,1,3
"650","(18:45) ⨂Fry: Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?
",3,1,3
"651","(18:48) ⨂Leela: Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.
",3,1,3
"652","(18:51) ⨂Fry: But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
",3,1,3
"653","(18:55) ⨂Bender: I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
",3,1,3
"654","(19:12) ⨂Fry: Hey, it works! The static's gone.
",3,1,3
"655","(19:15) ⨂Human Friend: [on TV] I hate that this came between us, Calculon.
",3,1,3
"656","(19:17) ⨂Calculon: [on TV] Me too. I'm filled with a large number of powerful emotions.
",3,1,3
"657","(19:21) ⨂Human Friend: [on TV] You're my best friend. I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
",3,1,3
"658","(19:25) ⨂Calculon: [on TV] Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
",3,1,3
"659","(19:31) ⨂Leela: You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
",3,1,3
"660","(19:33) ⨂Fry: She's right.
",3,1,3
"661","(19:35) ⨂Bender: You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly.
",3,1,3
"662","(19:40) ⨂Fry: Apology accepted. After all, you're only human.
",3,1,3
"663","(19:45) ⨂Leela: Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. [Fry and Bender stare blankly.] Fry's the one who should be-- [Fry and Bender keep staring.] Oh, never mind!
",3,1,3
"664","(19:57) ⨂Fry: What's wrong?
",3,1,3
"665","(19:58) ⨂Bender: Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
",3,1,3
"666","(20:03) ⨂Fry: Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?
",3,1,3
"667","(20:08) ⨂Bender: Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
",3,1,3
"668","(20:13) ⨂Smitty: Bingo!
",3,1,3
"669","(20:15) ⨂URL: You call that an antenna?
",3,1,3
"670","(20:22) ⨂Bender: This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy.
",3,1,3
"671","(20:33) ⨂Fry: It's good to be home.
",3,1,3
"672","(20:35) ⨂Bender: It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff.
",3,1,3
"673","(20:38) ⨂Fry: So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?
",3,1,3
"674","(20:44) ⨂Bender: There's a window in the closet.
",3,1,3
"675","(20:49) ⨂Fry: This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?
",3,1,3
"676","(20:53) ⨂Bender: In a closet? Oh, humans!
",3,1,3
"677","(00:03) ⨂Leela: This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
",4,1,4
"678","(00:08) ⨂Doug: You like the meal just wait until you try these after-dinner mints.
",4,1,4
"679","(00:10) ⨂Leela: You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded. [They gaze across the table into each other's eyes. Without averting his gaze, Doug slips out a long pink tongue and licks up the mint.] Ew!
",4,1,4
"680","(00:49) ⨂Fry: What was wrong with your date last night?
",4,1,4
"681","(00:51) ⨂Leela: I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
",4,1,4
"682","(00:57) ⨂Amy: You're too picky.
",4,1,4
"683","(00:58) ⨂Fry: Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely.
",4,1,4
"684","(01:05) ⨂Leela: There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--
",4,1,4
"685","(01:08) ⨂Zoidberg: The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
",4,1,4
"686","(01:15) ⨂Amy: You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body.
",4,1,4
"687","(01:22) ⨂Leela: Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is.
",4,1,4
"688","(01:27) ⨂Bender: That sounds like a cry for help.
",4,1,4
"689","(01:29) ⨂Amy: Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
",4,1,4
"690","(01:33) ⨂Hermes: The Federal Sex Bureau.
",4,1,4
"691","(01:34) ⨂Bender: A saucy puppet show.
",4,1,4
"692","(01:36) ⨂Zoidberg: The rotting carcass of a whale.
",4,1,4
"693","(01:38) ⨂Amy: Hmm, I'll pick!
",4,1,4
"694","(01:46) ⨂Amy: Oh, wow! It's totally retro!
",4,1,4
"695","(01:50) ⨂Fry: Why's everyone wearing those rings?
",4,1,4
"696","(01:52) ⨂Amy: Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
",4,1,4
"697","(01:55) ⨂Fry: I think they look cool.
",4,1,4
"698","(01:57) ⨂Amy: Sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
",4,1,4
"699","(01:59) ⨂Man: Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?
",4,1,4
"700","(02:01) ⨂Amy: Nope, he said they're stupid.
",4,1,4
"701","(02:03) ⨂Man: Cool!
",4,1,4
"702","(02:06) ⨂Amy: So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
",4,1,4
"703","(02:08) ⨂Leela: I don't know. Maybe?
",4,1,4
"704","(02:09) ⨂Bender: Forget it, he's gay.
",4,1,4
"705","(02:11) ⨂Leela: What? How can you tell?
",4,1,4
"706","(02:13) ⨂Bender: I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
",4,1,4
"707","(02:16) ⨂Leela: There's no such thing.
",4,1,4
"708","(02:18) ⨂Bender: No? [He pulls out a machine with a small antenna on it from his chest cabinet. The antenna swivels around.] OK, I got a lock on him. [The machine beeps.] Yep! He's gay!
",4,1,4
"709","(02:27) ⨂Amy: Are you sure?
",4,1,4
"710","(02:28) ⨂Bender: Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
",4,1,4
"711","(02:33) ⨂21st-century girl: You're from the 20th century? That's incredible! I'm from the 21st century.
",4,1,4
"712","(02:38) ⨂Fry: No way! We've got so much in common.
",4,1,4
"713","(02:40) ⨂21st-century girl: We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?
",4,1,4
"714","(02:44) ⨂Fry: Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.
",4,1,4
"715","(02:47) ⨂Amy: This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.
",4,1,4
"716","(02:53) ⨂Bolt: Hello, beautiful!
",4,1,4
"717","(02:55) ⨂Bender: [whispering] I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
",4,1,4
"718","(02:58) ⨂Bolt: I wish! Those cats can really fly.
",4,1,4
"719","(03:17) ⨂Amy: This is M5438, an entity of pure energy.
",4,1,4
"720","(03:21) ⨂Leela: That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for.
",4,1,4
"721","(03:25) ⨂M-5438: I understand. One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone.
",4,1,4
"722","(03:33) ⨂Amy: You're impossible.
",4,1,4
"723","(03:36) ⨂Bender: Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
",4,1,4
"724","(03:48) ⨂Fry: Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
",4,1,4
"725","(03:52) ⨂Bender: Can do!
",4,1,4
"726","(03:56) ⨂The Hip Joint janitor: My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady like you— [Leela looks up.] Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes.
",4,1,4
"727","(04:04) ⨂Bender: So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time.
",4,1,4
"728","(04:09) ⨂Leela: Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
",4,1,4
"729","(04:12) ⨂Farnsworth: Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to.
",4,1,4
"730","(04:18) ⨂Fry: A delivery?
",4,1,4
"731","(04:19) ⨂Farnsworth: No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
",4,1,4
"732","(04:23) ⨂Computer Voice: This is Vergon 6.
",4,1,4
"733","(04:25) ⨂Farnsworth: This is Vergon 6.
",4,1,4
"734","(04:27) ⨂Amy: [sarcastic] Buh!
",4,1,4
"735","(04:28) ⨂Farnsworth: It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.
",4,1,4
"736","(04:33) ⨂Leela: Animals?
",4,1,4
"737","(04:34) ⨂Farnsworth: That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds.
",4,1,4
"738","(04:47) ⨂Leela: Wait! What about the animals?
",4,1,4
"739","(04:49) ⨂Farnsworth: Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
",4,1,4
"740","(04:57) ⨂Leela: Yes, but what about the animals?
",4,1,4
"741","(05:00) ⨂Farnsworth: The wha?
",4,1,4
"742","(05:01) ⨂Leela: The animals.
",4,1,4
"743","(05:02) ⨂Farnsworth: I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
",4,1,4
"744","(05:09) ⨂Leela: So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
",4,1,4
"745","(05:13) ⨂Bender: Why two? [Leela whispers something to him.] Oh!
",4,1,4
"746","(05:21) ⨂Fry: I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
",4,1,4
"747","(05:24) ⨂Bender: That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out.
",4,1,4
"748","(05:29) ⨂Fry: Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.
",4,1,4
"749","(05:31) ⨂Leela: Do you mind?
",4,1,4
"750","(05:33) ⨂Bender: Here you go. [He pulls out a fork.] You can use this as an eye-poker.
",4,1,4
"751","(05:35) ⨂Leela: Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident...
",4,1,4
"752","(05:44) ⨂Leela: [from ship] ...maybe a snappy dresser.
",4,1,4
"753","(05:47) ⨂Zapp: These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?
",4,1,4
"754","(05:49) ⨂Kif: I suppose, Captain. I'm not as big a fan of velour as you are. Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?
",4,1,4
"755","(05:56) ⨂Zapp: Destroy them! [As he raises his arm he flexes his muscle. He stops to feel it.] Mmm! That's got a nice feel to it.
",4,1,4
"756","(06:05) ⨂Zapp: Captain's journal: Star date, 3000.3.
",4,1,4
"757","(06:08) ⨂Kif: Who are you talking to, sir?
",4,1,4
"758","(06:10) ⨂Zapp: You! Aren't you getting this? [Kif sighs and scurries to a typing machine. Zapp dictates.] We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner ... ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
",4,1,4
"759","(06:28) ⨂Leela: Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.
",4,1,4
"760","(06:30) ⨂Fry: Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
",4,1,4
"761","(06:33) ⨂Leela: Uh-huh!
",4,1,4
"762","(06:34) ⨂Fry: Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
",4,1,4
"763","(06:36) ⨂Kif: Shall I fire on them now, sir?
",4,1,4
"764","(06:38) ⨂Zapp: Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces. [Kif sighs.] What?
",4,1,4
"765","(06:45) ⨂Leela: They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
",4,1,4
"766","(06:51) ⨂Fry: Wow!
",4,1,4
"767","(06:52) ⨂Bender: A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!
",4,1,4
"768","(06:57) ⨂Leela: He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.
",4,1,4
"769","(07:01) ⨂Fry: [teasing] Leela's got a boyfriend!
",4,1,4
"770","(07:03) ⨂Leela: No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
",4,1,4
"771","(07:07) ⨂Bender: Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you. [He holds up the fork.]
",4,1,4
"772","(07:14) ⨂Kif: Sir, they're headed straight for us.
",4,1,4
"773","(07:16) ⨂Zapp: A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's Big Book of War. [He holds up the book with a picture of him on the front.] But the one thing their captain doesn't realise and never will is that--
",4,1,4
"774","(07:28) ⨂Kif: Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard.
",4,1,4
"775","(07:30) ⨂Zapp: Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod. [He gets up and heads for the door.] If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. box.
",4,1,4
"776","(07:42) ⨂Leela: Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance.
",4,1,4
"777","(07:48) ⨂Kif: Well, if there's anything--
",4,1,4
"778","(07:50) ⨂Zapp: I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?
",4,1,4
"779","(07:55) ⨂Leela: Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!
",4,1,4
"780","(08:00) ⨂Zapp: You're an impressive piece of captain. Beautiful and deadly -- a potent combination.
",4,1,4
"781","(08:05) ⨂Leela: [flattered] You don't mean that!
",4,1,4
"782","(08:07) ⨂Zapp: But I do. I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier.
",4,1,4
"783","(08:13) ⨂Fry: I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.
",4,1,4
"784","(08:19) ⨂Zapp: The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply a matter of outsmarting them.
",4,1,4
"785","(08:23) ⨂Fry: Wow! I never would have thought of that!
",4,1,4
"786","(08:25) ⨂Zapp: You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown. Kif, show them the medal I won. [Kif sighs and points to a medal on Zapp's uniform.]
",4,1,4
"787","(08:39) ⨂Zapp: More, please. [Kif grates.] A little more ... more ... keep going.
",4,1,4
"788","(08:45) ⨂Leela: Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission.
",4,1,4
"789","(08:47) ⨂Zapp: Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?
",4,1,4
"790","(08:53) ⨂Crewman: [shouting] You suck!
",4,1,4
"791","(08:54) ⨂Leela: We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--
",4,1,4
"792","(08:58) ⨂Zapp: Vergon 6? This light dinner is over.
",4,1,4
"793","(09:01) ⨂Leela: Wait! What's wrong?
",4,1,4
"794","(09:02) ⨂Zapp: The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds. It's a little rule known as ""Brannigan's Law"".
",4,1,4
"795","(09:09) ⨂Leela: But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
",4,1,4
"796","(09:14) ⨂Zapp: Yes, by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew.
",4,1,4
"797","(09:17) ⨂Leela: This doesn't make any sense.
",4,1,4
"798","(09:19) ⨂Zapp: I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law. I merely enforce it.
",4,1,4
"799","(09:23) ⨂Leela: Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
",4,1,4
"800","(09:26) ⨂Zapp: I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!
",4,1,4
"801","(09:30) ⨂Fry: What just happened?
",4,1,4
"802","(09:31) ⨂Bender: He's throwing us in prison.
",4,1,4
"803","(09:33) ⨂Fry: Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
",4,1,4
"804","(09:39) ⨂Leela: Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
",4,1,4
"805","(09:45) ⨂Bender: You really are too picky.
",4,1,4
"806","(09:46) ⨂Zapp: Kif, follow me up to the observation deck. I've got some musing to do.
",4,1,4
"807","(09:53) ⨂Kif: Oh, jeez!
",4,1,4
"808","(09:56) ⨂Zapp: I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif. Suggestions?
",4,1,4
"809","(10:00) ⨂Kif: I fail to see any problem, sir. You already imprisoned her under directive B-10.8-1.
",4,1,4
"810","(10:06) ⨂Zapp: You mean Brannigan's Law?
",4,1,4
"811","(10:08) ⨂Kif: Right, that law.
",4,1,4
"812","(10:10) ⨂Zapp: Which one?
",4,1,4
"813","(10:12) ⨂Kif: Brannigan's Law.
",4,1,4
"814","(10:13) ⨂Zapp: Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again. As my protégé you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her. [Kif sighs.] This time we are sure she's a woman, right?
",4,1,4
"815","(10:27) ⨂Kif: Yes.
",4,1,4
"816","(10:28) ⨂Zapp: Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.
",4,1,4
"817","(10:34) ⨂Kif: ""The boy"", sir?
",4,1,4
"818","(10:35) ⨂Zapp: You. You lay out my formal shorts.
",4,1,4
"819","(10:39) ⨂Kif: The jackass wants to see you in his quarters.
",4,1,4
"820","(10:42) ⨂Leela: Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain.
",4,1,4
"821","(10:46) ⨂Kif: And he wants you to wear this.
",4,1,4
"822","(10:51) ⨂Zapp: [sexilly; from inside] Come and get it!
",4,1,4
"823","(10:55) ⨂Zapp: Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, ""the Lovenasium"". Sham-pag-in?
",4,1,4
"824","(11:02) ⨂Leela: I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
",4,1,4
"825","(11:05) ⨂Zapp: Well I have studied abroad. Or two!
",4,1,4
"826","(11:11) ⨂Leela: Captain--
",4,1,4
"827","(11:12) ⨂Zapp: Uh-huh?
",4,1,4
"828","(11:13) ⨂Leela: If we could speak seriously for a moment--
",4,1,4
"829","(11:15) ⨂Zapp: Uh-huh?
",4,1,4
"830","(11:16) ⨂Leela: I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
",4,1,4
"831","(11:18) ⨂Zapp: Mm-hm. [He moves the bed closer to Leela. Leela pulls the plug out of the socket and the bed falls to the floor.] I like your style. I find it very... (whispering) erotic.
",4,1,4
"832","(11:31) ⨂Leela: What?
",4,1,4
"833","(11:32) ⨂Zapp: [shouting] Erotic!
",4,1,4
"834","(11:39) ⨂Fry: We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe.
",4,1,4
"835","(11:43) ⨂Bender: Hey, yeah!
",4,1,4
"836","(11:49) ⨂Fry: No good! It's full of steam!
",4,1,4
"837","(11:52) ⨂Zapp: You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things. Come over here and feel my velour bedspread.
",4,1,4
"838","(11:58) ⨂Leela: I'm not really in the mood.
",4,1,4
"839","(12:00) ⨂Zapp: Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself go.
",4,1,4
"840","(12:05) ⨂Leela: Can I please just go back to prison?
",4,1,4
"841","(12:07) ⨂Zapp: You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?
",4,1,4
"842","(12:11) ⨂Leela: Much rather! [Zapp starts to cry.] What are you doing?
",4,1,4
"843","(12:18) ⨂Zapp: [crying] Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. Just go. You want the rest of the sham-pag-in?
",4,1,4
"844","(12:26) ⨂Leela: No. And it's pronounced ""sham-pane"".
",4,1,4
"845","(12:29) ⨂Zapp: [crying] Oh, God, no!
",4,1,4
"846","(12:32) ⨂Leela: It's not a big deal.
",4,1,4
"847","(12:34) ⨂Zapp: [crying] I get so lonely. I just thought you, a fellow captain, would understand.
",4,1,4
"848","(12:39) ⨂Leela: Oh, forget it.
",4,1,4
"849","(12:40) ⨂Zapp: [crying] Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone.
",4,1,4
"850","(12:45) ⨂Leela: It comes with the job.
",4,1,4
"851","(12:48) ⨂Zapp: [crying] I'm just so lonely!
",4,1,4
"852","(12:52) ⨂Leela: Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad.
",4,1,4
"853","(12:57) ⨂Fry: You wanna try escaping again?
",4,1,4
"854","(12:59) ⨂Bender: Nah, I'm comfy.
",4,1,4
"855","(13:01) ⨂Fry: Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan.
",4,1,4
"856","(13:17) ⨂Zapp: Good morning, lover.
",4,1,4
"857","(13:19) ⨂Leela: Uh, listen, Zapp.
",4,1,4
"858","(13:21) ⨂Zapp: Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! I can't say I don't envy you.
",4,1,4
"859","(13:25) ⨂Leela: Zapp, last night was a mistake.
",4,1,4
"860","(13:27) ⨂Zapp: A sexy mistake.
",4,1,4
"861","(13:29) ⨂Leela: No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity.
",4,1,4
"862","(13:35) ⨂Zapp: A split second is all it takes. That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper.
",4,1,4
"863","(13:42) ⨂Leela: The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!
",4,1,4
"864","(13:46) ⨂Zapp: Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused.
",4,1,4
"865","(13:49) ⨂Leela: Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
",4,1,4
"866","(13:54) ⨂Zapp: Go ahead. I won't stop you.
",4,1,4
"867","(13:55) ⨂Leela: Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
",4,1,4
"868","(13:57) ⨂Zapp: We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy ... bam!
",4,1,4
"869","(14:09) ⨂Leela: Eurgh!
",4,1,4
"870","(14:13) ⨂Zapp: [shouting] Kif!
",4,1,4
"871","(14:15) ⨂Kif: Yes-- [He groans and looks away. Zapp is standing up holding the bed sheet over his crotch.] Yes, Captain?
",4,1,4
"872","(14:18) ⨂Zapp: I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
",4,1,4
"873","(14:24) ⨂Kif: The fatso says you're free to go.
",4,1,4
"874","(14:26) ⨂Fry: Really? Why?
",4,1,4
"875","(14:28) ⨂Kif: [quietly] ""Why"" indeed.
",4,1,4
"876","(14:30) ⨂Fry: What does that mean?
",4,1,4
"877","(14:31) ⨂Leela: [defensively] Nothing.
",4,1,4
"878","(14:32) ⨂Bender: So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
",4,1,4
"879","(14:35) ⨂Leela: [defensively] We just talked, OK?!
",4,1,4
"880","(14:46) ⨂Leela: Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago.
",4,1,4
"881","(15:24) ⨂Leela: Hello, there. [The animal sniffs around Leela's feet.] Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist.
",4,1,4
"882","(15:34) ⨂Bender: So, you're saying we can cook him?
",4,1,4
"883","(15:36) ⨂Fry: Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron.
",4,1,4
"884","(15:38) ⨂Leela: No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him. [She picks the thing up.] Aww! I'll call him Nibbler.
",4,1,4
"885","(15:47) ⨂Bender: Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
",4,1,4
"886","(15:51) ⨂Leela: I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
",4,1,4
"887","(16:12) ⨂Zapp: Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore.
",4,1,4
"888","(16:17) ⨂Kif: That's a shame, sir.
",4,1,4
"889","(16:19) ⨂Zapp: So let's make the most of our time together, shall we? [They sit in silence.] Never mind. Just give me a back rub.
",4,1,4
"890","(16:27) ⨂Bender: I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.
",4,1,4
"891","(16:29) ⨂Leela: Good. That's the last species.
",4,1,4
"892","(16:33) ⨂Bender: Hey. What the--?
",4,1,4
"893","(16:34) ⨂Fry: Where'd they all go?
",4,1,4
"894","(16:43) ⨂Leela: Nibbler!
",4,1,4
"895","(16:44) ⨂Fry: I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
",4,1,4
"896","(16:50) ⨂Bender: He's pending for a bending.
",4,1,4
"897","(16:54) ⨂Leela: Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?
",4,1,4
"898","(17:01) ⨂Fry: The planet's kerploding!
",4,1,4
"899","(17:09) ⨂Leela: Prepare for lift-off. [She turns the key in the ignition but the engine doesn't start. The fuel gauge reads empty.] We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left.
",4,1,4
"900","(17:17) ⨂Bender: Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.
",4,1,4
"901","(17:21) ⨂Fry: Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.
",4,1,4
"902","(17:24) ⨂Leela: No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
",4,1,4
"903","(17:27) ⨂Fry: What? What are you talking about?
",4,1,4
"904","(17:29) ⨂Leela: [defensively] Nothing. We just talked.
",4,1,4
"905","(17:31) ⨂Bender: So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him. [Leela hangs her head in shame.] Oh, my God!
",4,1,4
"906","(17:42) ⨂Fry: How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!
",4,1,4
"907","(17:47) ⨂Leela: That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
",4,1,4
"908","(17:51) ⨂Fry: No!
",4,1,4
"909","(17:53) ⨂Leela: Alright, alright. I'll call him. [She presses a button and the videophone comes down.] I mean, if living is that important to you.
",4,1,4
"910","(17:59) ⨂Zapp: And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif. [""Incoming Message"" repeatedly flashes on the viewscreen.] Hmm.
",4,1,4
"911","(18:04) ⨂Leela: [on screen] Hello, Zapp?
",4,1,4
"912","(18:05) ⨂Zapp: Well, well, well!
",4,1,4
"913","(18:08) ⨂Leela: Zapp, we're out of fuel...
",4,1,4
"914","(18:10) ⨂Leela: [on screen] ...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
",4,1,4
"915","(18:12) ⨂Zapp: So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
",4,1,4
"916","(18:18) ⨂Leela: [on screen] Bird's don't crawl.
",4,1,4
"917","(18:19) ⨂Zapp: They've been known to.
",4,1,4
"918","(18:21) ⨂Leela: Look, are you going to rescue us or not?
",4,1,4
"919","(18:23) ⨂Zapp: [on screen] Can't you ask a little more ... sexfully?
",4,1,4
"920","(18:29) ⨂Leela: [sexfully] Please?
",4,1,4
"921","(18:30) ⨂Leela: [sexfully; on screen] Big Z?
",4,1,4
"922","(18:32) ⨂Zapp: Certainly. But first you'll have to get rid of that thing. [He points at Nibbler] That's the law, Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: Hard and fast!
",4,1,4
"923","(18:42) ⨂Zapp: [on screen] Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety.
",4,1,4
"924","(18:45) ⨂Leela: I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!
",4,1,4
"925","(18:59) ⨂Zapp: [on screen] And which one rocked your world?
",4,1,4
"926","(19:03) ⨂Fry: Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
",4,1,4
"927","(19:07) ⨂Leela: Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death.
",4,1,4
"928","(19:10) ⨂Bender: Can do!
",4,1,4
"929","(19:13) ⨂Bender: What the hell was that?
",4,1,4
"930","(19:18) ⨂Fry: Pew!
",4,1,4
"931","(19:20) ⨂Leela: I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
",4,1,4
"932","(19:22) ⨂Bender: So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
",4,1,4
"933","(19:26) ⨂Leela: His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little-- [The ship shakes again.] Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine.
",4,1,4
"934","(20:04) ⨂Leela: We made it! [She looks through a pair of binoculars.] And some of the animals survived.
",4,1,4
"935","(20:09) ⨂Bender: So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
",4,1,4
"936","(20:15) ⨂Fry: We're heroes!
",4,1,4
"937","(20:18) ⨂Leela: [thinking] Dear Captain's Diary: I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
",4,1,4
"938","(20:32) ⨂Zapp: [from inside] Captain's journal: Star date ... uh.
",4,1,4
"939","(20:35) ⨂Kif: [from inside] April 13th.
",4,1,4

",4,1,4
"941","(20:40) ⨂Zapp: We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However, I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking you a question!
",4,1,4
"942","(00:03) ⨂Leela: What do you think of the view Fry?
",5,1,5
"943","(00:05) ⨂Fry: It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant.
",5,1,5
"944","(00:49) ⨂Bender: Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!
",5,1,5
"945","(00:54) ⨂Fry: I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
",5,1,5
"946","(00:58) ⨂Farnsworth: Baseball?? God forbid!
",5,1,5
"947","(01:00) ⨂Leela: Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.
",5,1,5
"948","(01:05) ⨂Fry: Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?
",5,1,5
"949","(01:14) ⨂Fry: Home run!! Woooo! Right?
",5,1,5
"950","(01:22) ⨂Umpire: Out!
",5,1,5
"951","(01:25) ⨂Fry: What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
",5,1,5
"952","(01:28) ⨂Leela: It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
",5,1,5
"953","(01:38) ⨂Bender: I got me a souvenir! [A kid looks sadly up at Bender] Aww here you go kid!
",5,1,5
"954","(01:49) ⨂Zoidberg: I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.
",5,1,5
"955","(01:52) ⨂Man: We don't sell those.
",5,1,5
"956","(01:53) ⨂Zoidberg: Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll.
",5,1,5
"957","(01:57) ⨂Man: We're out of rolls.
",5,1,5
"958","(01:58) ⨂Zoidberg: Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
",5,1,5
"959","(02:05) ⨂Fry: Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed.
",5,1,5
"960","(02:07) ⨂Bender: Hey buddies who wants popcorn?
",5,1,5
"961","(02:10) ⨂All: I'll have some, me, yeah!
",5,1,5
"962","(02:15) ⨂Bender: Anyone want butter on that?
",5,1,5
"963","(02:19) ⨂Fry: Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?
",5,1,5
"964","(02:27) ⨂Leela: Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!
",5,1,5
"965","(02:50) ⨂Fry: What just happened?
",5,1,5
"966","(02:53) ⨂Leela: Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
",5,1,5
"967","(02:58) ⨂Farnsworth: He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.
",5,1,5
"968","(03:05) ⨂Bender: Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!
",5,1,5
"969","(03:15) ⨂Leela: Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
",5,1,5
"970","(03:22) ⨂Bender: Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
",5,1,5
"971","(03:27) ⨂Leela: Yep.
",5,1,5
"972","(03:28) ⨂Bender: You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
",5,1,5
"973","(03:32) ⨂Fry: What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
",5,1,5
"974","(03:35) ⨂Bender: Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?
",5,1,5
"975","(03:43) ⨂Fry: Eleven?
",5,1,5
"976","(03:44) ⨂Bender: Zero! [He throws his bottle on the floor and it breaks. A small robot comes out and cleans it up.] And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
",5,1,5
"977","(03:53) ⨂Farnsworth: Oh dear Lord!
",5,1,5
"978","(03:54) ⨂Fry: What's wrong?
",5,1,5
"979","(03:56) ⨂Farnsworth: It's...my...new...pager.
",5,1,5
"980","(04:01) ⨂Hermes: [on pager] : This is Hermes. A package just came in. Everyone is to return to the office immediately. [The crew grumble. A pigeon lands next to Hermes' image.] Get away you filthy bird! Shoo! Professor turn me off quick!
",5,1,5
"981","(04:14) ⨂Farnsworth: I'm sorry what?
",5,1,5
"982","(04:16) ⨂Hermes: [on pager] : Argh! [The bird takes off with the hologram. Hermes screams.] See you at the office!
",5,1,5
"983","(04:21) ⨂Bender: Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
",5,1,5
"984","(04:26) ⨂Fry: Well, aren't they?
",5,1,5
"985","(04:27) ⨂Bender: I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
",5,1,5
"986","(04:30) ⨂Farnsworth: Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!
",5,1,5
"987","(04:37) ⨂Fry: Why is that great news?
",5,1,5
"988","(04:39) ⨂Farnsworth: I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
",5,1,5
"989","(04:48) ⨂Bender: Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
",5,1,5
"990","(04:53) ⨂Leela: Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?
",5,1,5
"991","(04:58) ⨂Farnsworth: They're not fans.
",5,1,5
"992","(05:00) ⨂Hermes: That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
",5,1,5
"993","(05:02) ⨂Bender: Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!
",5,1,5
"994","(05:06) ⨂Leela: This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
",5,1,5
"995","(05:09) ⨂Bender: Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
",5,1,5
"996","(05:13) ⨂Fry: Really? Which one?
",5,1,5
"997","(05:14) ⨂Bender: Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
",5,1,5
"998","(05:18) ⨂Leela: Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
",5,1,5
"999","(05:24) ⨂Fry: Man that one was a blast!
",5,1,5
"1000","(05:25) ⨂Bender: It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
",5,1,5
"1001","(05:33) ⨂Hermes: Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.
",5,1,5
"1002","(05:42) ⨂Bender: All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives.
",5,1,5
"1003","(05:50) ⨂Farnsworth: Well then it's settled. So long everyone!
",5,1,5
"1004","(05:56) ⨂Fry: So let me get this straight: This planet is completely uninhabited?
",5,1,5
"1005","(05:59) ⨂Bender: No. It's inhabited by robots!
",5,1,5
"1006","(06:02) ⨂Fry: Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
",5,1,5
"1007","(06:08) ⨂Leela: OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work.
",5,1,5
"1008","(06:11) ⨂Bender: Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale.
",5,1,5
"1009","(06:15) ⨂Leela: Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember: You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!
",5,1,5
"1010","(06:28) ⨂Bender: I'll try to keep that in mind!
",5,1,5
"1011","(06:33) ⨂Leela: Hmm, he seems pretty angry.
",5,1,5
"1012","(06:35) ⨂Fry: Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
",5,1,5
"1013","(06:39) ⨂Leela: Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
",5,1,5
"1014","(06:43) ⨂Leela: There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.
",5,1,5
"1015","(06:48) ⨂Fry: Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.
",5,1,5
"1016","(06:52) ⨂Bender: [on screen] : I'm in trouble. they found out I work with humans and - oh no, oh no!
",5,1,5
"1017","(07:01) ⨂Fry: Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
",5,1,5
"1018","(07:03) ⨂Leela: No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
",5,1,5
"1019","(07:05) ⨂Fry: Well what are we going to do?
",5,1,5
"1020","(07:06) ⨂Leela: I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it.
",5,1,5
"1021","(07:12) ⨂Leela: OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots.
",5,1,5
"1022","(07:16) ⨂Fry: [robot voice] : I am fully operational Captain.
",5,1,5
"1023","(07:18) ⨂Leela: We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots.
",5,1,5
"1024","(07:24) ⨂Fry: I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?
",5,1,5
"1025","(07:32) ⨂Leela: Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...
",5,1,5
"1026","(07:49) ⨂Fry: Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes.
",5,1,5
"1027","(07:53) ⨂Leela: Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
",5,1,5
"1028","(07:56) ⨂Robot guard #1: Halt!
",5,1,5
"1029","(07:57) ⨂Robot guard #2: Be you robot or human?
",5,1,5
"1030","(07:59) ⨂Leela: Robot...we be.
",5,1,5
"1031","(08:01) ⨂Fry: Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up! [He sort of dances like a robot.] Eh?
",5,1,5
"1032","(08:08) ⨂Robot guard #1: Administer the test.
",5,1,5
"1033","(08:13) ⨂Robot guard #2: Which of the following would you most prefer? A: A puppy? B: A pretty flower from your sweetie or C: A large properly formatted data file?
",5,1,5
"1034","(08:23) ⨂Robot guard #1: Choose!
",5,1,5
"1035","(08:27) ⨂Fry: Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
",5,1,5
"1036","(08:29) ⨂Robot guard #2: No. It is the bad kind of puppy.
",5,1,5
"1037","(08:32) ⨂Leela: Then we'll go with that data file.
",5,1,5
"1038","(08:34) ⨂Robot guard #2: Correct.
",5,1,5
"1039","(08:35) ⨂Robot guard #1: The flower would also have been acceptable.
",5,1,5
"1040","(08:37) ⨂Robot guard #2: You may pass.
",5,1,5
"1041","(08:45) ⨂Leela: Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way. [An alarm sounds. Hundreds of robots come out of doors from all sides towards Fry and Leela. Another alarm. The robots clear the area.] So far, so good.
",5,1,5
"1042","(09:05) ⨂Robot builder: Little to the right, there you go.
",5,1,5
"1043","(09:07) ⨂Leela: Have you seen this robot?
",5,1,5
"1044","(09:11) ⨂Robot builder: Sorry, can't help you. [To the crane.] Hey, watch it! Don't drop that there! [The crane drops a brick into the wall and it disappears.] Aw!
",5,1,5
"1045","(09:19) ⨂Leela: Come on Fry, walk like a robot.
",5,1,5
"1046","(09:22) ⨂Fry: I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
",5,1,5
"1047","(09:24) ⨂Leela: Robot's don't have bathrooms.
",5,1,5
"1048","(09:26) ⨂Fry: Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.
",5,1,5
"1049","(09:29) ⨂Leela: Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
",5,1,5
"1050","(09:38) ⨂Leela: Hurry up Fry.
",5,1,5
"1051","(09:41) ⨂Resin-offering robot: Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking coolant at an alarming rate?
",5,1,5
"1052","(09:44) ⨂Fry: Uh...
",5,1,5
"1053","(09:46) ⨂Resin-offering robot: Well let me just patch you up with some hot resin.
",5,1,5
"1054","(09:48) ⨂Fry: I think the leak's stopping itself. [It doesn't.] Wait. [Still going.] Wait. Yeah, there we go. [Starts again.] Wait. Yeah!
",5,1,5
"1055","(09:57) ⨂Resin-offering robot: What sort of robot turns down a free blast of searing hot resin?
",5,1,5
"1056","(10:01) ⨂Leela: I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
",5,1,5
"1057","(10:07) ⨂Resin-offering robot: Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't keep you.
",5,1,5
"1058","(10:24) ⨂Patrol Officer #1: Get the humanoids.
",5,1,5
"1059","(10:25) ⨂Patrol Officer #2: Get the intruder.
",5,1,5
"1060","(10:26) ⨂Announcer: [on loudspeaker] : Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
",5,1,5
"1061","(10:32) ⨂Leela: Quick! Let's duck in here!
",5,1,5
"1062","(10:42) ⨂Announcer: [on radio in movie] : We interrupt this sound file to bring you a terrifying announcement. A non-metallic being has been sighted in the vicinity of Make Out Point.
",5,1,5
"1063","(10:50) ⨂Rusty: [in movie] : Say Wendy. Your chassis is a little scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?
",5,1,5
"1064","(10:58) ⨂Wendy: [in movie] : Did you hear that Rusty? It sounded like a human.
",5,1,5
"1065","(11:01) ⨂Rusty: [in movie] : Relax Wendy. Humans will never come to our defenceless little town. It's perfectly safe to let our guard down - even for a second.
",5,1,5
"1066","(11:13) ⨂Robot Human: [in movie] Graaah! [It tears Rusty's head off and eats it. Wendy screams.] I will eat and digest you all with my system of mighty organs! Behold!
",5,1,5
"1067","(11:24) ⨂Audience: Ooooo!
",5,1,5
"1068","(11:26) ⨂Fry: Wow the 3-D's great!
",5,1,5
"1069","(11:28) ⨂Leela: Mine's not working!
",5,1,5
"1070","(11:35) ⨂Robot General: [in movie] : Funny, isn't it? The human was impervious to our most powerful magnetic fields, yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless sharpened stick!
",5,1,5
"1071","(11:49) ⨂Wendy: [in movie] : I'm just glad the nightmare is over.
",5,1,5
"1072","(11:51) ⨂Robot General: [in movie] : It'll never be over Wendy. Even now humans are lurking in our playgrounds, our breezeways, perhaps even...our movie theatres!
",5,1,5
"1073","(12:01) ⨂Fry: God help us!
",5,1,5
"1074","(12:05) ⨂Leela: OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.
",5,1,5
"1075","(12:07) ⨂Robot #1: So what did you think of the movie?
",5,1,5
"1076","(12:09) ⨂Fry: Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing.
",5,1,5
"1077","(12:12) ⨂Robot #2: Yeah, it was a real chick flick.
",5,1,5
"1078","(12:16) ⨂Leela: What's that?
",5,1,5
"1079","(12:17) ⨂Robot #1: What do you mean ""What's that?""? Its 5 o'clock: Time for the daily human hunt.
",5,1,5
"1080","(12:23) ⨂Leela: Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
",5,1,5
"1081","(12:26) ⨂Crummy Robot: Awww that was uncalled for!
",5,1,5
"1082","(12:28) ⨂Fry: I'm over here!
",5,1,5
"1083","(12:33) ⨂Robot #4: I heard a human was draining coolant behind garbage can 738.
",5,1,5
"1084","(12:36) ⨂Robot #5: I heard they unscrew our lugnuts at night and eat them at their human brunches.
",5,1,5
"1085","(12:41) ⨂Robot Mayor: Welcome to a very special human hunt. We have with us today a guest who's irrational hatred of humans makes me look like a human sympathiser! [The crowd laughs.] A newly arrived refugee from Earth, lets hear it for - Bender!
",5,1,5
"1086","(12:59) ⨂Fry: It's him. He's OK!
",5,1,5
"1087","(13:01) ⨂Bender: Death to humans!
",5,1,5
"1088","(13:05) ⨂Fry: Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
",5,1,5
"1089","(13:09) ⨂Bender: Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!
",5,1,5
"1090","(13:28) ⨂Fry: My God! He's become evil. [Leela stares at him.] I mean eviler!
",5,1,5
"1091","(13:32) ⨂Bender: Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine.
",5,1,5
"1092","(13:44) ⨂Bender Figurine: Bite my shiny metal ass!
",5,1,5
"1093","(13:49) ⨂Robot Mayor: Let the hunt begin!
",5,1,5
"1094","(14:01) ⨂Bender: Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.
",5,1,5
"1095","(14:09) ⨂Robot #1: Is it true they bite your neck, suck your transmission fluid and then you become a human?
",5,1,5
"1096","(14:12) ⨂Bender: Sure, why not?
",5,1,5
"1097","(14:15) ⨂Robot #1: Anything in the trap?
",5,1,5
"1098","(14:16) ⨂Bender: Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
",5,1,5
"1099","(14:20) ⨂Robot Mayor: Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful hunts in a row. But I've got a good feeling about tomorrow.
",5,1,5
"1100","(14:27) ⨂Bender: Wait, what's that?
",5,1,5
"1101","(14:30) ⨂Robot Mayor: Oh thats the old abandoned adult book store. Nothing in there except a few mouldy old shreads of robot pornography.
",5,1,5
"1102","(14:36) ⨂Bender: Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out.
",5,1,5
"1103","(14:44) ⨂Bender: Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?
",5,1,5
"1104","(14:48) ⨂Fry: Psst! Bender!
",5,1,5
"1105","(14:49) ⨂Bender: Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
",5,1,5
"1106","(14:53) ⨂Fry: We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
",5,1,5
"1107","(14:57) ⨂Bender: I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
",5,1,5
"1108","(15:02) ⨂Leela: Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
",5,1,5
"1109","(15:04) ⨂Bender: What for?
",5,1,5
"1110","(15:05) ⨂Fry: We're rescuing you.
",5,1,5
"1111","(15:06) ⨂Bender: I don't wanna be rescued.
",5,1,5
"1112","(15:08) ⨂Fry: Say what?
",5,1,5
"1113","(15:09) ⨂Bender: I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring.
",5,1,5
"1114","(15:15) ⨂Fry: But Bender, we're your friends.
",5,1,5
"1115","(15:17) ⨂Bender: Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair.
",5,1,5
"1116","(15:27) ⨂Fry: That's not true.
",5,1,5
"1117","(15:28) ⨂Bender: Well that's how it feels to me.
",5,1,5
"1118","(15:35) ⨂Fry: Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
",5,1,5
"1119","(15:37) ⨂Bender: Go on, get out of here before you get caught.
",5,1,5
"1120","(15:40) ⨂Robot Mayor: Bender, good news. Your album just went gold! What the?
",5,1,5
"1121","(15:44) ⨂Robot #1: Its the humans!
",5,1,5
"1122","(15:47) ⨂Robot Mayor: Bender! Do something!
",5,1,5
"1123","(15:49) ⨂Bender: Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!
",5,1,5
"1124","(15:56) ⨂Robot Mayor: Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans before us are guilty of the crime of being humans. Come to think of it, I rest my case!
",5,1,5

",5,1,5
"1127","(16:15) ⨂Leela: Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human.

",5,1,5
"1139","(16:46) ⨂Judge: The humans are hereby sentenced to live as robots live on Earth. They will perform tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, until they become obsolete and are given away to an inner-city middle school.

",5,1,5

",5,1,5
"1151","(17:31) ⨂Blue Elder: Silence! It is time to put the humans to death!
",5,1,5
"1152","(17:35) ⨂Fry: But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
",5,1,5
"1153","(17:38) ⨂Orange Elder: Silence! That was just a show for the public. We are the true rulers of this planet, hand carved from meteorites by the Robot Founders, over four centuries ago.
",5,1,5
"1154","(17:47) ⨂Blue Elder: Silence! Come forward Bender. You will have the honour of executing the prisoners.
",5,1,5
"1155","(17:52) ⨂Green Elder: Silence! I concur!
",5,1,5
"1156","(17:54) ⨂Orange Elder: Here. Use the ceremonial killamajig.
",5,1,5
"1157","(18:01) ⨂Bender: Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?
",5,1,5
"1158","(18:07) ⨂Blue Elder: No! The Elders have spoken. Show us the killing skills than have made you a media darling.
",5,1,5
"1159","(18:13) ⨂Green Elder: Do it now! Kill them before they bring down our whole society!
",5,1,5

",5,1,5
"1161","(18:25) ⨂Bender: Aww! [He throws the killamajig away. The Elders gasp.] I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards.
",5,1,5
"1162","(18:43) ⨂Fry: Damn right!
",5,1,5
"1163","(18:44) ⨂Bender: The fact is, humans are completely harmless.
",5,1,5
"1164","(18:48) ⨂Blue Elder: We're well aware of that.
",5,1,5
"1165","(18:50) ⨂Bender: You are?
",5,1,5
"1166","(18:51) ⨂Blue Elder: Of course. But they're useful to us as a scapegoat to distract the public from their real problem.
",5,1,5
"1167","(18:56) ⨂Green Elder: Like our crippling lugnut shortage.
",5,1,5
"1168","(18:58) ⨂Orange Elder: And a corrupt government of incompetent Robot Elders.
",5,1,5
"1169","(19:01) ⨂Lime Elder: Duh, that's for sure.
",5,1,5
"1170","(19:03) ⨂Blue Elder: Quiet Jimmy.

"1175","(19:24) ⨂Leela: He'll do it. He's crazy!
",5,1,5
"1176","(19:27) ⨂Orange Elder: Can they really breathe fire or did we make that up?
",5,1,5
"1177","(19:29) ⨂Blue Elder: Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might just be from that stupid movie.
",5,1,5
"1178","(19:33) ⨂Green Elder: Was that the original or the re-make?
",5,1,5
"1179","(19:35) ⨂Blue Elder: I don't - hey! They're getting away.
",5,1,5
"1180","(19:47) ⨂Fry: So long suckers! [The robots stand on each others shoulders] Uh, hello suckers!
",5,1,5
"1181","(19:54) ⨂Bender: Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.
",5,1,5
"1182","(20:06) ⨂Robot #1: Lugnuts! Precious lugnuts!
",5,1,5

",5,1,5
"1184","(20:14) ⨂Bender: Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!
",5,1,5
"1185","(20:19) ⨂Fry: We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
",5,1,5
"1186","(20:23) ⨂Bender: Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?
",5,1,5
"1187","(20:28) ⨂Leela: Of course.
",5,1,5
"1188","(20:29) ⨂Fry: But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!
",5,1,5
"1189","(20:32) ⨂Bender: In that case - let the dancing begin! [Fry and Leela do their robot dances.] Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
",5,1,5
"1190","(00:08) ⨂Fry: I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours! [He bangs on the wall.] (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!
",6,1,6
"1191","(00:20) ⨂Robot: [shouting] Sorry!
",6,1,6
"1192","(00:56) ⨂Teacher: Good morning, class. I trust you've all prepared for today's final exam.
",6,1,6
"1193","(01:00) ⨂Fry: Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?
",6,1,6
"1194","(01:05) ⨂Teacher: Ancient Egyptian algebra.
",6,1,6
"1195","(01:08) ⨂Fry: What a nightmare!
",6,1,6
"1196","(01:09) ⨂Teacher: Mister Fry, are those your underpants? [Fry looks down and sees he is wearing only his briefs. He stands up and the whole class laughs and points. He gasps.] Young man, I think it's time you learned a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.
",6,1,6
"1197","(01:22) ⨂Announcer: [voice-over] Lightspeed fits today's active lifestyle. Whether you're on the job ... [Fry suddenly appears in a company meeting wearing just Lightspeeds.] ... or having fun. [He sits with a woman on a bed.] Lightspeed briefs, style and comfort for the discriminating crotch.
",6,1,6
"1198","(01:33) ⨂Fry: What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
",6,1,6
"1199","(01:44) ⨂Fry: So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
",6,1,6
"1200","(01:47) ⨂Leela: Of course.
",6,1,6
"1201","(01:48) ⨂Fry: But, how is that possible?
",6,1,6
"1202","(01:49) ⨂Farnsworth: It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg. [He holds up an egg and injects it with liquid. The egg explodes, covering him and Leela in yolk.] Although, in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation.
",6,1,6
"1203","(02:00) ⨂Fry: That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
",6,1,6
"1204","(02:03) ⨂Leela: Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
",6,1,6
"1205","(02:05) ⨂Fry: Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!
",6,1,6
"1206","(02:20) ⨂Bender: Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything.
",6,1,6
"1207","(02:24) ⨂Amy: Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices.
",6,1,6
"1208","(02:45) ⨂Perfume saleswoman: Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance from Calvin Clone?
",6,1,6
"1209","(02:49) ⨂Amy: No thanks.
",6,1,6
"1210","(02:52) ⨂Perfume saleswoman: And you, sir?
",6,1,6
"1211","(02:53) ⨂Bender: No thanks. I--
",6,1,6
"1212","(02:59) ⨂Cosmetologist: What a lovely face. We just need to draw attention away from the eye area.
",6,1,6
"1213","(03:13) ⨂Fry: Cool. [He walks over to a salesman.] Can I try these on before I buy them?
",6,1,6
"1214","(03:17) ⨂Salesman: I'm afraid I can't let you open the package. But you can try on the demo pair.
",6,1,6
"1215","(03:27) ⨂Fry: Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!
",6,1,6
"1216","(03:48) ⨂Amy: Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.
",6,1,6
"1217","(03:50) ⨂Bender: New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
",6,1,6
"1218","(04:00) ⨂Salesman: $30, please.
",6,1,6
"1219","(04:01) ⨂Fry: $30? I can't afford that. Unless... [He pulls out his wallet.] Do you take Visa?
",6,1,6
"1220","(04:06) ⨂Salesman: Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.
",6,1,6
"1221","(04:08) ⨂Fry: American Express?
",6,1,6
"1222","(04:09) ⨂Salesman: 600 years.
",6,1,6
"1223","(04:11) ⨂Fry: Discover card?
",6,1,6
"1224","(04:12) ⨂Salesman: Sorry we don't take Discover.
",6,1,6
"1225","(04:14) ⨂Amy: Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
",6,1,6
"1226","(04:17) ⨂Fry: No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?
",6,1,6
"1227","(04:23) ⨂Amy: Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
",6,1,6
"1228","(04:27) ⨂Mom: [on screen] Hello, shoppers. It's me, Mom!
",6,1,6
"1229","(04:29) ⨂Fry: Hey who's the rocker jockey?
",6,1,6
"1230","(04:31) ⨂Amy: Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
",6,1,6
"1231","(04:34) ⨂Mom: [on screen] Call me old-fashioned, but when my robot starts to squeak like an old screen door, well, that's when I reach for a can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.
",6,1,6
"1232","(04:44) ⨂Bender: Mmm, tasty!
",6,1,6
"1233","(04:45) ⨂Mom: [on screen] And remember: Mom's oil is made with 10% more love than the next leading brand!

",6,1,6
"1235","(04:57) ⨂Fry: Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil.
",6,1,6
"1236","(05:03) ⨂Bender: I'm boned.
",6,1,6
"1237","(05:04) ⨂Smitty: Freeze, scuzzbot!
",6,1,6
"1238","(05:05) ⨂Bender: Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here. [More tins fall out.] I'm sure there's-- [More tins fall out.] I say I'm sure there's-- [Even more tins fall out.] That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--
",6,1,6
"1239","(05:30) ⨂Amy: Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
",6,1,6
"1240","(05:33) ⨂Fry: [counting] 78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short.
",6,1,6
"1241","(05:38) ⨂Leela: I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.
",6,1,6
"1242","(05:43) ⨂Fry: Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open.
",6,1,6
"1243","(05:51) ⨂Teller: Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina scan, your fingerprint or your colonic map on file.
",6,1,6
"1244","(05:56) ⨂Fry: Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?
",6,1,6
"1245","(06:02) ⨂Teller: Do you still remember your PIN number?
",6,1,6
"1246","(06:03) ⨂Fry: Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza.
",6,1,6
"1247","(06:09) ⨂Teller: OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...
",6,1,6
"1248","(06:12) ⨂Fry: Alright!
",6,1,6
"1249","(06:14) ⨂Teller: And at an average of two-and-a-quarter percent interest over a period of 1000 years, that comes to ... $4.3 billion.
",6,1,6
"1250","(06:29) ⨂Hermes: To Fry.
",6,1,6
"1251","(06:37) ⨂Amy: Cheers!
",6,1,6
"1252","(06:38) ⨂Leela: I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?
",6,1,6
"1253","(06:41) ⨂Bender: Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle.
",6,1,6
"1254","(07:13) ⨂Fry: Pizza dinner on me! [The others cheer.] Just keep the tab under $50 million.
",6,1,6
"1255","(07:18) ⨂Robot Chef: Yo! [He whistles.] I haven't got all day. What kind of pizza yous guys want?
",6,1,6
"1256","(07:22) ⨂Fry: Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!
",6,1,6
"1257","(07:30) ⨂Robot Chef: [mechanical voice] Invalid selection. (normal voice) Yo, what are you talking about?
",6,1,6
"1258","(07:33) ⨂Fry: Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
",6,1,6
"1259","(07:35) ⨂Robot Chef: [mechanical voice] Does not compute. Does not compute.
",6,1,6
"1260","(07:40) ⨂Farnsworth: I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's.
",6,1,6
"1261","(07:45) ⨂Fry: What?
",6,1,6
"1262","(07:46) ⨂Farnsworth: Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?
",6,1,6
"1263","(07:52) ⨂Zoidberg: [defensively] I'm not on trial here.
",6,1,6
"1264","(07:53) ⨂Fry: So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--
",6,1,6
"1265","(08:01) ⨂Zoidberg: Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying ""One more can't hurt"" and then they were gone. We're sorry!
",6,1,6
"1266","(08:10) ⨂Fry: I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
",6,1,6
"1267","(08:18) ⨂Bender: Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are. [He puts his monocle back on.] Huh? Huh?
",6,1,6
"1268","(08:31) ⨂Fry: So? What do you think?
",6,1,6
"1269","(08:34) ⨂Leela: I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. [She stamps the floorboards.] The floors are made of such hard wood.
",6,1,6
"1270","(08:39) ⨂Bender: Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
",6,1,6
"1271","(08:43) ⨂Fry: What's wrong with it?
",6,1,6
"1272","(08:44) ⨂Bender: Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture.
",6,1,6
"1273","(08:50) ⨂Amy: That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
",6,1,6

"1276","(09:01) ⨂Fry: Yes!
",6,1,6

",6,1,6
"1278","(09:07) ⨂Fry: I have an idea for a sitcom.
",6,1,6
"1279","(09:09) ⨂Bender: Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK.
",6,1,6
"1280","(09:14) ⨂Leela: You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
",6,1,6

",6,1,6
"1317","(11:29) ⨂Fry: I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's eight o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!
",6,1,6
"1318","(11:43) ⨂Leela: You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
",6,1,6
"1319","(11:46) ⨂Fry: I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
",6,1,6
"1320","(11:49) ⨂Leela: Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past.
",6,1,6

",6,1,6

",6,1,6
"1324","(12:05) ⨂Fry: Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things.
",6,1,6
"1325","(12:12) ⨂Bender: [sadly] I'm a thing.
",6,1,6
"1326","(12:13) ⨂Fry: Just leave me alone.

",6,1,6
"1330","(12:36) ⨂Mom: Could you shut the door, Igner, dear? I think I feel a draught coming on. [Igner closes the door and Mom's torso open up, revealing it to be just a body suit.

",6,1,6
"1335","(13:04) ⨂Mom: It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, Fry, must know their secret. And I won't rest until I get my hands on them. No one messes with Mom!
",6,1,6
"1336","(13:24) ⨂Walt: Quiet, you!
",6,1,6
"1337","(13:29) ⨂Mom: As you boys know, one of the cornerstones of my empire is Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil. Think of it: 10 billion robots, each one needing an oil change every 3000 miles. You don't have to do the math to know that's a buttload of oil.
",6,1,6
"1338","(13:45) ⨂Igner: Can I wear your fat suit?

"1339","(13:46) ⨂Mom: [shouting] No, Igner, put that down!
",6,1,6
"1340","(13:49) ⨂Walt: What does this have to do with the anchovies?
",6,1,6
"1341","(13:51) ⨂Mom: I'm getting to the freaking anchovies. [She turns on a TV displaying an anchovy.] A single drop of the anchovies' natural oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.

",6,1,6
"1343","(14:02) ⨂Mom: [shouting] No, it isn't! Shut your filthy trap! [Walt slaps Larry.] (talking) Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of Third-World kids and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear, old Mom out of businness.

"1344","(14:19) ⨂Walt: My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind of the highest order.
",6,1,6
"1345","(14:29) ⨂Fred: [on TV] Esther, you ugly!
",6,1,6
"1346","(14:32) ⨂Mom: We have only one option: We'll have to bankrupt Mr. Fry, so he'll be forced to sell the anchovies to us.
",6,1,6
"1347","(14:37) ⨂Walt: Mother, you are one clever old skag!
",6,1,6
"1348","(14:40) ⨂Mom: And don't you forget it!

",6,1,6
"1350","(14:44) ⨂Mom: That part will be easy, thanks to the nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video Surveillance Unit.

",6,1,6
"1352","(14:52) ⨂Fry: [on TV] Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza. [The tape rewinds.] It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda--

",6,1,6
"1363","(15:42) ⨂Walt: You're in the good old year 2000, working here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep on the job.
",6,1,6
"1364","(15:48) ⨂Fry: That sounds like me but I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
",6,1,6
"1365","(15:53) ⨂Walt: No, you only ""dreamed"" you were in the year 3000.
",6,1,6

",6,1,6
"1369","(16:07) ⨂Walt: No. Now go work the currency register, I think I hear a customer coming. [No one enters.] I said, ""I think I hear a customer coming""!

",6,1,6
"1371","(16:19) ⨂Larry: Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't take long. Now, your motivation is you're back in the year 2000 and your head's still on your body, and you want a cheese pizza.
",6,1,6
"1372","(16:31) ⨂Anderson: OK. But I'm only doing this so people will take my head seriously as an actress.
",6,1,6
"1373","(16:37) ⨂Fry: Hey, look! Anchovies!
",6,1,6
"1374","(16:38) ⨂Walt: Of course. They're not extinct yet. And if you need further proof that this is really a thousand years ago, well, here's contemporary actress, Pamela Anderson!
",6,1,6

",6,1,6
"1376","(16:53) ⨂Anderson: Hello, Fry. Remember me from Baywatch: The Movie?
",6,1,6
"1377","(16:56) ⨂Fry: Uh...
",6,1,6

",6,1,6
"1379","(17:01) ⨂Walt: [whispering] It hasn't been made yet.
",6,1,6
"1380","(17:02) ⨂Anderson: [whispering] Then he doesn't know I won the Oscar?

",6,1,6

",6,1,6
"1408","(18:59) ⨂Farnsworth: Uh, wha? Oh, yes! They say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of...

",6,1,6
"1416","(19:34) ⨂Fry: Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
",6,1,6

",6,1,6
"1418","(19:44) ⨂Fry: You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important: My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. [Bender and Leela look at each other.] That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like.
",6,1,6

",7,1,7
"1459","(03:50) ⨂Leela: Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here.

",7,1,7
"1495","(06:00) ⨂Bender: Now for a dash of salt! [He coats the slug in salt and it starts to shrivel up.] Uh-oh!
",7,1,7
"1496","(06:12) ⨂Leela: [whispering] Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?
",7,1,7
"1497","(06:17) ⨂Fry: Yeah, OK.
",7,1,7
"1498","(06:18) ⨂Zoidberg: Alright.
",7,1,7
"1499","(06:20) ⨂Leela: [shouting] Oh, dear God!
",7,1,7
"1500","(06:23) ⨂Fry: That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I've once ate a big, heaping bowl of salt!
",7,1,7
"1501","(06:30) ⨂Amy: Bender, is this salt water?
",7,1,7
"1502","(06:31) ⨂Bender: It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
",7,1,7
"1503","(06:35) ⨂Fry: My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
",7,1,7
"1504","(06:37) ⨂Bender: There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
",7,1,7
"1505","(06:44) ⨂Zoidberg: Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
",7,1,7
"1506","(06:53) ⨂Leela: OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver. And for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one.
",7,1,7
"1507","(07:02) ⨂Fry: Ow!
",7,1,7
"1508","(07:03) ⨂Leela: Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back.
",7,1,7
"1509","(07:09) ⨂Fry: Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing.
",7,1,7
"1510","(07:25) ⨂Fry: Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. [He looks across at the setting sun.] Oh, come on! Go down already! [The sun finally sets.] Ah!
",7,1,7
"1511","(07:53) ⨂Fry: Hello? Anybody home?
",7,1,7
"1512","(08:14) ⨂Guard #1: The royal bottle is empty!
",7,1,7
"1513","(08:16) ⨂Guard #2: You drank our Emperor!
",7,1,7
"1514","(08:18) ⨂Fry: No! It wasn't me!
",7,1,7
"1515","(08:25) ⨂Guard #1: [shouting] You drank our Emperor! You assassinated him!
",7,1,7
"1516","(08:28) ⨂Fry: I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
",7,1,7
"1517","(08:31) ⨂Guard #3: I'm sure he was.
",7,1,7
"1518","(08:33) ⨂Guard #1: But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. All hail the new Emperor.
",7,1,7
"1519","(08:41) ⨂Guards: [chanting] Hail! Hail! Hail!
",7,1,7
"1520","(08:46) ⨂Leela: So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!
",7,1,7
"1521","(08:53) ⨂Fry: It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
",7,1,7
"1522","(08:57) ⨂Merg: Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, the High Priest. If I might interject?
",7,1,7
"1523","(09:01) ⨂Fry: You might.
",7,1,7
"1524","(09:02) ⨂Merg: I humbly advise that as your first act you choose a capable Prime Minister. I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.
",7,1,7
"1525","(09:09) ⨂Gorgak: I will be a forceful and effective administrator.
",7,1,7
"1526","(09:12) ⨂Bender: You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister.
",7,1,7
"1527","(09:16) ⨂Fry: I gotta go with Bender.
",7,1,7
"1528","(09:17) ⨂Bender: Yes! In your face, Gorgak!
",7,1,7
"1529","(09:19) ⨂Leela: That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head.
",7,1,7
"1530","(09:24) ⨂Fry: Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister.
",7,1,7
"1531","(09:28) ⨂Bender: Stay the course, pal!
",7,1,7
"1532","(09:30) ⨂Gorgak: Your Highness, a package came for you.
",7,1,7
"1533","(09:34) ⨂Fry: Hey, thanks! [He takes the package and opens it. It is a sign saying ""Please Don't Drink The Emperor!""] Wow! This got here just in time.
",7,1,7
"1534","(09:43) ⨂Merg: This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
",7,1,7
"1535","(09:48) ⨂Fry: Um, how about that one?
",7,1,7
"1536","(09:51) ⨂Merg: Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was into that sort of thing!
",7,1,7
"1537","(09:55) ⨂Fry: On second thought, I'll take that one.
",7,1,7
"1538","(09:58) ⨂Merg: Hey, whatever you say. I'm not here to pass judgement.
",7,1,7
"1539","(10:01) ⨂Leela: Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?
",7,1,7
"1540","(10:08) ⨂Fry: You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela. We all know who you're talking about ... uh, me, right?
",7,1,7
"1541","(10:14) ⨂Amy: I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
",7,1,7
"1542","(10:18) ⨂Zoidberg: They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now.
",7,1,7
"1543","(10:23) ⨂Gorgak: You touched me in ways I've never been touched before.
",7,1,7
"1544","(10:28) ⨂Merg: Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's time to begin preparing for tomorrow's coronation ceremony.
",7,1,7
"1545","(10:33) ⨂Zoidberg: A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
",7,1,7
"1546","(10:37) ⨂Merg: Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the setting of the three suns when we Trisolians enter our nocturnal phase.
",7,1,7
"1547","(10:43) ⨂Fry: There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?
",7,1,7
"1548","(10:45) ⨂Merg: Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation from memory of the royal oath. By you.
",7,1,7
"1549","(10:53) ⨂Fry: Will there be cake?
",7,1,7
"1550","(10:57) ⨂Zoidberg: Yeah, I know.
",7,1,7
"1551","(10:58) ⨂Amy: [to Gorgak] Hi!
",7,1,7
"1552","(11:01) ⨂Fry: There you go.
",7,1,7
"1553","(11:09) ⨂Gorgak: And now, get ready to laugh till your sides leak with our planet's foremost political satirist, Florp!
",7,1,7
"1554","(11:20) ⨂Florp: So what is the deal with people from under the orange sun? They're all... [He does a funny walk. Fry laughs.] But us guys from under the red sun, we're like... [He imitates does another funny walk.] Right? Am I right?
",7,1,7
"1555","(11:38) ⨂Fry: Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!
",7,1,7
"1556","(11:41) ⨂Leela: [whispering] Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger.
",7,1,7
"1557","(11:46) ⨂Leela: You see Emperor Plon here? [She points at a painting.] He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab.
",7,1,7
"1558","(11:53) ⨂Fry: So?
",7,1,7
"1559","(11:54) ⨂Leela: Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
",7,1,7
"1560","(11:59) ⨂Fry: 80,000 years?
",7,1,7
"1561","(12:00) ⨂Leela: No. One week.
",7,1,7
"1562","(12:02) ⨂Fry: Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
",7,1,7
"1563","(12:06) ⨂Leela: Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
",7,1,7
"1564","(12:15) ⨂Fry: Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him.
",7,1,7
"1565","(12:17) ⨂Leela: You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation.
",7,1,7
"1566","(12:22) ⨂Fry: Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself.
",7,1,7
"1567","(12:25) ⨂Leela: No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory.
",7,1,7
"1568","(12:33) ⨂Fry: Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later.
",7,1,7
"1569","(12:35) ⨂Leela: That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
",7,1,7
"1570","(12:38) ⨂Fry: Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?
",7,1,7
"1571","(13:04) ⨂Leela: I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
",7,1,7
"1572","(13:08) ⨂Fry: Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper.
",7,1,7
"1573","(13:16) ⨂Leela: That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship.
",7,1,7
"1574","(13:22) ⨂Fry: I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me. [A panel slides across on a portrait and a Trisolian tries to drink Fry with a straw.] Quit it!
",7,1,7
"1575","(13:34) ⨂Merg: People of Trisol, it is my honour to present your new Emperor.
",7,1,7
"1576","(13:45) ⨂Fry: What up?
",7,1,7
"1577","(13:48) ⨂Merg: Stick to the oath.
",7,1,7
"1578","(13:49) ⨂Fry: Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant...
",7,1,7
"1579","(14:00) ⨂Fry: (reading) Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!
",7,1,7
"1580","(14:12) ⨂Merg: Congratulations, Your Highness. [He takes Fry's shirt off him.] I now present you with your royal unisex robe. Long live Fry the Solid!
",7,1,7
"1581","(14:26) ⨂Bender: Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!
",7,1,7
"1582","(14:43) ⨂Bender: Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?
",7,1,7
"1583","(14:52) ⨂Merg: The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.
",7,1,7
"1584","(14:55) ⨂Bont: Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep open and drain me out!
",7,1,7
"1585","(15:01) ⨂Fry: My tummy hurts!
",7,1,7
"1586","(15:08) ⨂Bont: They're over here, they're running up the stairs.
",7,1,7
"1587","(15:10) ⨂Bender: Shut up, you!
",7,1,7
"1588","(15:12) ⨂Fry: Ow!
",7,1,7
"1589","(15:18) ⨂Merg: Let us in!
",7,1,7
"1590","(15:19) ⨂Merg: [from outside] Fry must die so that Bont may live.
",7,1,7
"1591","(15:22) ⨂Fry: What am I gonna do?
",7,1,7
"1592","(15:23) ⨂Amy: We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
",7,1,7
"1593","(15:26) ⨂Zoidberg: Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness.
",7,1,7
"1594","(15:33) ⨂Fry: But won't that crush my bones?
",7,1,7
"1595","(15:35) ⨂Zoidberg: Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
",7,1,7
"1596","(15:39) ⨂Bender: Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?
",7,1,7
"1597","(15:41) ⨂Bont: Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be dripped out through somebody's armpit.
",7,1,7
"1598","(15:45) ⨂Fry: I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
",7,1,7
"1599","(15:48) ⨂Bont: Slightly. But my favourite so far is the bone-crushing.
",7,1,7
"1600","(15:51) ⨂Amy: What about crying?
",7,1,7
"1601","(15:52) ⨂Fry: That's a great idea! Crying.
",7,1,7
"1602","(15:55) ⨂Bont: Fine. That or the bone one.
",7,1,7
"1603","(16:00) ⨂Merg: Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting to peel.
",7,1,7
"1604","(16:03) ⨂Gorgak: Oh, dear!
",7,1,7
"1605","(16:07) ⨂Fry: It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
",7,1,7
"1606","(16:10) ⨂Bender: I'll make you cry, buddy! [He clears his throat.] You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything.
",7,1,7
"1607","(16:17) ⨂Fry: What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
",7,1,7
"1608","(16:20) ⨂Bender: Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder: Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
",7,1,7
"1609","(16:28) ⨂Fry: These things happen.
",7,1,7
"1610","(16:31) ⨂Bender: OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!
",7,1,7
"1611","(16:40) ⨂Fry: Phew! That's a load off my mind.
",7,1,7
"1612","(16:43) ⨂Bender: Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry.
",7,1,7
"1613","(16:46) ⨂Amy: You did your best, Bender.
",7,1,7
"1614","(16:47) ⨂Bender: Up yours, bimbo!
",7,1,7
"1615","(16:51) ⨂Zoidberg: Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help.
",7,1,7
"1616","(16:55) ⨂Bender: Cram it, lobster! [Zoidberg bursts into tears.] That is a good idea. I'll go call her.
",7,1,7
"1617","(17:00) ⨂Fry: She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
",7,1,7
"1618","(17:04) ⨂Amy: C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
",7,1,7
"1619","(17:13) ⨂Operator: [on phone] Collect call from...
",7,1,7
"1620","(17:14) ⨂Bender: [on phone] I'm not giving my name to a machine.
",7,1,7
"1621","(17:16) ⨂Leela: I'll accept.
",7,1,7
"1622","(17:18) ⨂Bender: [on screen] Fry's in trouble...
",7,1,7
"1623","(17:20) ⨂Bender: And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me.
",7,1,7
"1624","(17:23) ⨂Leela: [on screen] I like you.
",7,1,7
"1625","(17:24) ⨂Bender: You do? Look, are you going to help or not?
",7,1,7
"1626","(17:28) ⨂Leela: [on screen] I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
",7,1,7
"1627","(17:30) ⨂Bender: Wait, wait, wait, wait. [He crosses his legs and taps his chin.] What is it you like best about me?
",7,1,7
"1628","(17:33) ⨂Amy: Is she coming?
",7,1,7
"1629","(17:34) ⨂Bender: I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
",7,1,7
"1630","(17:48) ⨂Fry: What the hell is that?
",7,1,7
"1631","(17:49) ⨂Bont: Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain my juices from you while filtering out the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded remains.
",7,1,7
"1632","(17:56) ⨂Zoidberg: Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
",7,1,7
"1633","(17:59) ⨂Fry: This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
",7,1,7
"1634","(18:06) ⨂Bender: Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
",7,1,7
"1635","(18:17) ⨂Amy: Oh, no! They have her totally outnumbered.
",7,1,7
"1636","(18:20) ⨂Fry: I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
",7,1,7
"1637","(18:27) ⨂Bender: You do? Hmm.
",7,1,7
"1638","(18:30) ⨂Fry: Is she alright?
",7,1,7
"1639","(18:31) ⨂Bender: I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her.
",7,1,7
"1640","(18:40) ⨂Fry: No. No!
",7,1,7
"1641","(18:41) ⨂Amy: What are you talking about, Bender? She's al-- [Bender puts his hand over Amy's mouth and she eventually catches on.] (muffled) Oh!
",7,1,7
"1642","(18:44) ⨂Bender: They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it.
",7,1,7
"1643","(18:52) ⨂Fry: This can't be happening.
",7,1,7
"1644","(18:53) ⨂Bender: It can and, for all you know, it is. [He puts his hand on Fry's shoulder.] I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.
",7,1,7
"1645","(19:09) ⨂Fry: All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it. [He throws his crown across the room.] I wish I had died instead of her.
",7,1,7
"1646","(19:18) ⨂Leela: What are you talking about?
",7,1,7
"1647","(19:21) ⨂Fry: Leela! You're alive!
",7,1,7
"1648","(19:22) ⨂Leela: Of course I'm alive.
",7,1,7
"1649","(19:24) ⨂Bender: I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
",7,1,7
"1650","(19:30) ⨂Amy: We only got two drops.
",7,1,7
"1651","(19:37) ⨂Bont: It's only a matter of time now.
",7,1,7
"1652","(19:39) ⨂Zoidberg: I'll handle this!
",7,1,7
"1653","(19:45) ⨂Leela: Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you.
",7,1,7
"1654","(19:48) ⨂Fry: Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me. [Leela smiles then stamps on his foot.] Ow! What was that for? [She slaps him.] Hey, come on! [He bursts into tears.] That hurt!
",7,1,7
"1655","(20:03) ⨂Leela: I know. Amy, get the bottle.
",7,1,7
"1656","(20:09) ⨂Fry: [crying] Oh, now I understand.
",7,1,7
"1657","(20:10) ⨂Leela: Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
",7,1,7
"1658","(20:17) ⨂Fry: [crying] Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!
",7,1,7
"1659","(20:26) ⨂Leela: How we doing, Amy?
",7,1,7
"1660","(20:27) ⨂Amy: Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
",7,1,7
"1661","(20:37) ⨂Amy: OK, it's your turn.
",7,1,7
"1662","(20:40) ⨂Fry: Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?
",7,1,7
"1663","(20:43) ⨂Bont: I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me out.
",7,1,7
"1664","(20:47) ⨂Fry: Oh, you're welcome.
",7,1,7
"1665","(20:55) ⨂Bender: [from inside] Hey! Save some for me!
",7,1,7
"1666","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet.
",8,1,8
"1667","Hermes: Why can't they go today?
",8,1,8
"1668","Farnsworth: Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium.
",8,1,8
"1669","Fry: Wow! I love symposia.
",8,1,8
"1670","Farnsworth: It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
",8,1,8
"1671","Bender: Sounds boring.
",8,1,8
"1672","Farnsworth: Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock. [He places a small black box on top on the table.] Simply jam your finger in the hole and this read-out tells you exactly how long you have left to live.
",8,1,8
"1673","Leela: Does it really work?
",8,1,8
"1674","Farnsworth: Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
",8,1,8
"1675","Fry: Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?

",8,1,8
"1679","Farnsworth: That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me.

"1680","Wernstrom: Well, well, well. Look who decided to show his wrinkled face.
",8,1,8
"1681","Farnsworth: Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?
",8,1,8
"1682","Wernstrom: Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the hill. It's time to leave science to the 120-year-olds.
",8,1,8
"1683","Farnsworth: You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
",8,1,8
"1684","Wernstrom: Go home before you embarrass yourself, old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take a nap before the ceremonies.
",8,1,8
"1685","Fry: Who's that jerk?
",8,1,8
"1686","Farnsworth: A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then, after one fateful pop-quiz...
",8,1,8
"1687","Wernstrom: A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom an A-minus!
",8,1,8
"1688","Farnsworth: I'm sorry, but penmanship counts.
",8,1,8
"1689","Wernstrom: I swear I'll have my revenge even if it takes me a hundred years.
",8,1,8
"1690","Farnsworth: And here it is: Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.
",8,1,8
"1691","Bender: I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Parté and the '66 Thunder Chevitz.
",8,1,8
"1692","Waiter: Exquisite choices, sir.
",8,1,8
"1693","Bender: And mix them all together in a big jug.
",8,1,8
"1694","Popeil: Welcome to this year's Academy of Inventors Annual Symposium. I'm your host, Ron Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, the spray-on toupee and, of course, the technology to keep human heads alive in jars. [A few people applaud.] But wait, there's more. We've got a whole line-up of inventors tonight, starting with that up and coming young star, Ogden Wernstrom.
",8,1,8
"1695","Bender: [shouting] More wine!
",8,1,8
"1696","Wernstrom: Distinguished members of the Academy, I present to you, the Reverse Scuba Suit. Observe! [He waves a stick in front of a fish in a tank.] Fetch! [He throws the stick across the platform and his fish puts on the suit, which has two little mechanical legs. The fish gets out of the tank, walks across the stage, picks up the stick and hands it to Wernstrom.] Now, sit! [The fish doesn't do anything.] I said sit! [Still nothing.] Bad fish!
",8,1,8
"1697","Fry: Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock.
",8,1,8
"1698","Wernstrom: And what will you be presenting this evening, grandpa?
",8,1,8
"1699","Farnsworth: Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
",8,1,8
"1700","Wernstrom: I just hope it's not as lame as that death clock you presented last year.
",8,1,8
"1701","Farnsworth: Uh, last year, you say?
",8,1,8
"1702","Wernstrom: That's right.
",8,1,8
"1703","Farnsworth: Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
",8,1,8
"1704","Wernstrom: Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
",8,1,8
"1705","Farnsworth: Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.
",8,1,8
"1706","Leela: Uh, Professor...?
",8,1,8
"1707","Popeil: Our last presentation comes from our oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. Professor?
",8,1,8
"1708","Farnsworth: Just a second, just a second.
",8,1,8
"1709","Wernstrom: Pencils down, prune-face.
",8,1,8
"1710","Farnsworth: Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention ... the Smellescope.
",8,1,8
"1711","Man: Oh, I say!
",8,1,8
"1712","Farnsworth: The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy. [The audience laughs.] But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me. [The audience laughs again. Farnsworth wipes his brow with the paper.] Oh, my!
",8,1,8
"1713","Wernstrom: I've waited a hundred years for this, Farnsworth. I give your invention the worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.
",8,1,8
"1714","Popeil: And now for the presentation of the award. Listen, folks, I'm practically giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, for his fish thingy.
",8,1,8
"1715","Farnsworth: Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
",8,1,8
"1716","Bender: Yep!
",8,1,8
"1717","Fry: No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!
",8,1,8
"1718","Farnsworth: By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!
",8,1,8
"1719","Farnsworth: Eureka!
",8,1,8
"1720","Fry: Did you build the Smellescope?
",8,1,8
"1721","Farnsworth: No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead, try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter.
",8,1,8
"1722","Fry: Smells like strawberries.
",8,1,8
"1723","Farnsworth: Exactly! And now Saturn.
",8,1,8
"1724","Fry: Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus.
",8,1,8
"1725","Leela: I don't get it.
",8,1,8
"1726","Farnsworth: I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.
",8,1,8
"1727","Fry: Oh. What's it called now?
",8,1,8
"1728","Farnsworth: Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
",8,1,8
"1729","Fry: No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here! [He points the Smellescope around the sky and sniffs.] Hmm. [He sniffs again.] Hmm.
",8,1,8
"1730","Farnsworth: What is it? [He sniffs and reacts.] Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe.
",8,1,8
"1731","Bender: Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
",8,1,8
"1732","Leela: I think it's moving.
",8,1,8
"1733","Farnsworth: Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory. [He clicks a few buttons.] My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours.
",8,1,8
"1734","Bender: Well, let's get looting!
",8,1,8
"1735","Fry: So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city? [A hologram of the object hits the hologram of the Earth with a splat.] What the heck is it?
",8,1,8
"1736","Farnsworth: Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
",8,1,8
"1737","Narrator: [voice-over; in movie] New York City: The year 2000. The most wasteful society in the history of the galaxy and it was running out of places to empty its never-ending output of garbage. [People throw black bags full of rubbish out of office windows and they are bulldozed away.] The landfills were full. New Jersey was full. And so, under cover of darkness, the city put its garbage out to sea on the world's largest barge. [A man resembling Rudy Giuliani unties a barge filled with garbage and pushes it away from the pier.] The repulsive barge circled the oceans for 50 years but no country would accept it, not even that really filthy one. You know the one I mean. Finally, in 2052, the city used its mob connections to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage into outer space. Some experts claim the ball might return to Earth someday, but their concerns were dismissed as ""depressing"".
",8,1,8
"1738","Fry: Wow! You got that off the Internet?  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
",8,1,8
"1739","Farnsworth: Actually that's still true.
",8,1,8
"1740","Female Scientist: [in movie] Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions.
",8,1,8
"1741","Male Scientist: [in movie] With gusto!
",8,1,8
"1742","Farnsworth: So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage.
",8,1,8
"1743","Leela: Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?
",8,1,8
"1744","Fry: Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?
",8,1,8
"1745","Leela: We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
",8,1,8
"1746","Bender: Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
",8,1,8
"1747","Leela: And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches. [Fry looks inside the sandwich and cringes.] Nothing just gets thrown away.
",8,1,8
"1748","Fry: The future is disgusting.
",8,1,8
"1749","Leela: Typical 20th century attitude.
",8,1,8
"1750","Fry: Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin.
",8,1,8
"1751","Leela: Those things are all from the 19th century.
",8,1,8
"1752","Fry: Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
",8,1,8
"1753","Farnsworth: Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
",8,1,8
"1754","Poopenmeyer: Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.
",8,1,8
"1755","Farnsworth: Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.
",8,1,8
"1756","Poopenmeyer: I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific fraud like global warming or second-hand smoke. [He presses the intercom.] Send in my science advisor.
",8,1,8
"1757","Farnsworth: Wernstrom!
",8,1,8
"1758","Wernstrom: Well, well, well! Come to present your latest napkin, Professor?
",8,1,8
"1759","Farnsworth: No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself.
",8,1,8
"1760","Poopenmeyer: Hey! Holy jeez!
",8,1,8
"1761","Wernstrom: That smell could be anything; a faulty stench coil, some cheese on the lens, who knows?
",8,1,8
"1762","Woman: Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission from Neptune.
",8,1,8
"1763","Man: [on tape] Giant ... garbage ball ... [A gasp.] ... passed close by ... horrible stench.
",8,1,8
"1764","Woman: The transmission cuts out there, sir. [The voice chokes again.] No, I, guess it keeps going.
",8,1,8
"1765","Woman: There we go.
",8,1,8
"1766","Poopenmeyer: My God! The senile old man is right.
",8,1,8
"1767","Wernstrom: Do you mean him or me?
",8,1,8
"1768","Poopenmeyer: Him!
",8,1,8
"1769","Linda: [on TV] Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?
",8,1,8
"1770","Morbo: [on TV] Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings were shocked today to learn that a ball of garbage will destroy their pathetic city of New New York.
",8,1,8
"1771","Linda: [on TV] Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.
",8,1,8
"1772","Morbo: [on TV] Morbo agrees!
",8,1,8
"1773","Leela: Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
",8,1,8
"1774","Military Man: We've simulated that on a supercomputer but the ball is just too damn gooey. A missile would go right through it.
",8,1,8
"1775","Farnsworth: But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
",8,1,8
"1776","Military Man: In theory, it could work.
",8,1,8
"1777","Wernstrom: Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never find a crew willing to take on a mission so suicidally dangerous.
",8,1,8
"1778","Bender: Oh, crap!
",8,1,8
"1779","Farnsworth: Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions.
",8,1,8
"1780","Bender: [ironic] Oh, boo-hoo!
",8,1,8
"1781","Farnsworth: Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away.
",8,1,8
"1782","Leela: That's all? But--
",8,1,8
"1783","Farnsworth: Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return.
",8,1,8
"1784","Leela: Odour at magnitude 8. [The ship shakes.] Magnitude 12. [The ship shakes.] Magnitude 31. [The ship shakes.] We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
",8,1,8
"1785","Fry: Hmm, sporty!
",8,1,8
"1786","Fry: Wow!
",8,1,8
"1787","Leela: Look at all this filth.
",8,1,8
"1788","Fry: It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. [He picks up something.] Look! A real Beanie Baby. [He picks up something else.] Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate! [He sees something and gasps.] Some Bart Simpson dolls!
",8,1,8
"1789","Doll: Eat my shorts!
",8,1,8
"1790","Bender: OK [He eats the shorts.] [´ la Homer Simpson] Mmm! Shorts!
",8,1,8
"1791","Leela: Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!
",8,1,8
"1792","Fry: This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
",8,1,8
"1793","Fry: [gasping] Alright, let's get to work.
",8,1,8
"1794","Leela: Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here. [She puts the bomb in the ground.] Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. [She presses the button and the timer changes to 15:00.] Uh, 15 minutes. [The timer changes again to 05:00.] 5 minutes. [The timer changes again to a very odd number.] ""6h"" minutes?
",8,1,8
"1795","Bender: There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
",8,1,8
"1796","Leela: That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds.
",8,1,8
"1797","Fry: We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
",8,1,8
"1798","Bender: Right!
",8,1,8
"1799","Bender: It's gonna blow!
",8,1,8
"1800","Leela: Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!
",8,1,8
"1801","Bender: OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this.
",8,1,8
"1802","Fry: We're saved!
",8,1,8
"1803","Leela: Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for.
",8,1,8
"1804","Linda: [on TV] All in all, this is one day Mittens the kitten won't soon forget!
",8,1,8
"1805","Morbo: [on TV] Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter news, the city of New New York is doomed. Blame rests with known human Professor Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior brain.
",8,1,8
"1806","Farnsworth: Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely. [He pulls out the manual from his coat. It is upside-down.] I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault.
",8,1,8
"1807","Fry: No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can. [Poopenmeyer cringes.] Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me.
",8,1,8
"1808","Poopenmeyer: Enough! You all failed miserably. It's time to put a real scientist in charge.
",8,1,8
"1809","Farnsworth: Wernstrom!
",8,1,8
"1810","Wernstrom: The very same.
",8,1,8
"1811","Poopenmeyer: Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?
",8,1,8
"1812","Wernstrom: Of course. But it'll cost you. First I'll need tenure.
",8,1,8
"1813","Poopenmeyer: Done.
",8,1,8
"1814","Wernstrom: And a big research grant.
",8,1,8
"1815","Poopenmeyer: You got it.
",8,1,8
"1816","Wernstrom: Also, access to a lab and five graduate students, at least three of them Chinese.
",8,1,8
"1817","Poopenmeyer: Um, alright done. What's your plan?
",8,1,8
"1818","Wernstrom: What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, suckers!
",8,1,8
"1819","Leela: That rat! Do something!
",8,1,8
"1820","Poopenmeyer: I wish I could but he's got tenure!
",8,1,8
"1821","Poopenmeyer: It's time to take action. [He presses the intercom.] Stephanie, cancel the maid for today. Have her come tomorrow. [He leans back into his chair.] Well, I'm out of ideas. Anyone?
",8,1,8
"1822","Farnsworth: Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits.
",8,1,8
"1823","Leela: But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
",8,1,8
"1824","Farnsworth: Alas, I don't know.
",8,1,8
"1825","Fry: Uh, what about garbage?
",8,1,8
"1826","Farnsworth: Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
",8,1,8
"1827","Poopenmeyer: But garbage isn't something you just find lying in the streets of Manhattan. This city's been garbage-free for 500 years!
",8,1,8
"1828","Fry: Then it's time to make some more.
",8,1,8
"1829","Poopenmeyer: Make garbage? But how?
",8,1,8
"1830","Fry: Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can. [He knocks it on the floor.] Now it's garbage. These papers. [He sweeps them off the desk with his hands.] Garbage. This picture of your wife. [He drops it on the floor and the frame smashes.] Pure garbage. Now you try it.
",8,1,8
"1831","Poopenmeyer: By God, I think the boy's got something. Come on, everyone! The fate of the city is at stake!
",8,1,8
"1832","Fry: Good! [He turns to Leela.] Don't finish that cruller, throw it away [Leela throws it on the floor.] Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground. [Bender throws the bottle on the floor.] Very nice.
",8,1,8
"1833","Poopenmeyer: Get that robot some more beer! [Bender smiles.] We've trashed this room but that's just the start. We've got to get Fry's message to the people.
",8,1,8
"1834","Fry: [on TV] People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor.
",8,1,8
"1835","Fry: [on TV] Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
",8,1,8
"1836","Farnsworth: If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun.
",8,1,8
"1837","Wernstrom: And if my calculations are correct, we're all going to die horribly.
",8,1,8
"1838","Poopenmeyer: Alright, places everyone. Prepare for launch.
",8,1,8
"1839","Farnsworth: Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six...
",8,1,8

",8,1,8
"1841","Fry: Oops!
",8,1,8
"1842","Farnsworth: Burning garbage!
",8,1,8
"1843","Fry: It worked!
",8,1,8
"1844","Poopenmeyer: And so, on behalf of the entire city, I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I now present you with the Academy prize, which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom after it became apparent that he was a jackass.
",8,1,8
"1845","Farnsworth: Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!
",8,1,8
"1846","Wernstrom: I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it takes me another hundred years.
",8,1,8

",8,1,8
"1849","Fry: Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
",8,1,8
"1850","Farnsworth: Exactly! It's none of our concern.

"1882","Bender: Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
",9,1,9
"1883","Bender: Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
",9,1,9
"1884","Fender: Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking on! [He plugs himself into the machine and shocks himself.] Aw, yeah! [He takes the plug out and offers it to Bender.] Wanna jolt?
",9,1,9
"1885","Bender: Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?
",9,1,9
"1886","Robot: Counter indicated!
",9,1,9
"1887","Fender: Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told these guys you were cool.
",9,1,9
"1888","Bender: Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!
",9,1,9
"1889","Fender: Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked on this stuff.
",9,1,9
"1890","Bender: Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality.
",9,1,9
"1891","Fry: Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?
",9,1,9
"1892","Bender: Shut up, square! [Bender walks off the street down into a place called Sparky's Den. His shades fall off. His eyes are blue and electrified.] I'll just be a minute!
",9,1,9
"1893","Preacherbot: Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot heaven lies here ... [He takes out a 3.5"" disk.] ... in The Good Book 3.0.
",9,1,9
"1894","Bender: Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
",9,1,9
"1895","Fry: Who was that guy?
",9,1,9
"1896","Bender: Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
",9,1,9
"1897","Hermes: Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
",9,1,9
"1898","Zoidberg: Me?
",9,1,9
"1899","Amy: Good morning, Bender.
",9,1,9
"1900","Bender: None of your business! Get off my back!
",9,1,9
"1901","Amy: What's his problem?
",9,1,9
"1902","Leela: If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
",9,1,9
"1903","Fry: Bender? No way! [The lights dim.] I definitely would've noticed something.
",9,1,9
"1904","Leela: Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
",9,1,9
"1905","Bender: [from inside] No! Don't come in!
",9,1,9
"1906","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!
",9,1,9
"1907","Bender: Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second.
",9,1,9
"1908","Fry: I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
",9,1,9
"1909","Leela: Did he use his tongue?
",9,1,9
"1910","Fry: A little. [Leela cringes. Bender sits in the corner chewing his fingers.] You OK, Bender?
",9,1,9
"1911","Bender: None of your business! Get off my back!
",9,1,9
"1912","Leela: Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
",9,1,9
"1913","Bender: A what kind of disturbance?
",9,1,9
"1914","Leela: Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it.
",9,1,9
"1915","Leela: We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
",9,1,9
"1916","Fry: What's happening? I-I feel weird!
",9,1,9
"1917","Bender: Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! [Lightning strikes Bender's antenna and he jitters. Another bolt strikes him and a third. His legs melt.] Oh, mama!
",9,1,9
"1918","Bender: What?
",9,1,9
"1919","Leela: Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
",9,1,9
"1920","Zoidberg: In fact, that's why we loved you.
",9,1,9
"1921","Leela: But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
",9,1,9
"1922","Fry: And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
",9,1,9
"1923","Bender: You're right. I'm a lost cause.
",9,1,9
"1924","Bender: Maybe there's another way.
",9,1,9
"1925","Bender: Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff. [The sign short circuits. Bender unplugs himself and cries.] [crying] What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?
",9,1,9
"1926","Preacherbot: I see a lot of fancy robots here today, made of real shiny metal. But that don't impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!
",9,1,9
"1927","Vergerbot: No, sir!
",9,1,9
"1928","Preacherbot: 'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna plug his infernal modem in the wall, belchin' smoke and flame. And he's gonna download you straight to Robot Hell!
",9,1,9
"1929","Vergerbot: Straight to hell!
",9,1,9
"1930","Preacherbot: So I ask you: Who will stand up and be saved? Who? Who?
",9,1,9
"1931","Bender: [weakly] Me.
",9,1,9
"1932","Hermes: And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt-water cooler.
",9,1,9
"1933","Zoidberg: This is a witch hunt!
",9,1,9
"1934","Bender: [singing] Oh, what a beautiful morning,
Oh what a beautiful day!
(talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?
",9,1,9
"1935","Fry: Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
",9,1,9
"1936","Bender: No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion.
",9,1,9
"1937","Fry: Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
",9,1,9
"1938","Leela: Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive.
",9,1,9
"1939","Farnsworth: [simultaneous] Yes.
",9,1,9
"1940","Amy: [simultaneous] Oh, yeah.
",9,1,9
"1941","Hermes: [simultaneous] Oh, yes!
",9,1,9
"1942","Zoidberg: [simultaneous] Oh, yeah.
",9,1,9
"1943","Bender: Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!
",9,1,9
"1944","Preacherbot: We are gathered here today to deliver brother Bender from the cold, steel grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, steel bosom of our congregation.
",9,1,9
"1945","Robot #2: Tell it, Preacher!
",9,1,9
"1946","Robot #3: That equals true.
",9,1,9
"1947","Preacherbot: Brother Bender, do you accept the principles of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation in Robot Hell?
",9,1,9
"1948","Bender: Yes, I do.
",9,1,9
"1949","Preacherbot: Then I will now baptise you. [A keyboard appear from his waist.] Press any key to continue.
",9,1,9
"1950","Bender: Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?
",9,1,9
"1951","Leela: This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
",9,1,9
"1952","Bender: The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
",9,1,9
"1953","Waiter: Would monsieur care to see the wine list?
",9,1,9
"1954","Bender: No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil. [He drinks the oil.] Ah! Functional!
",9,1,9
"1955","Hermes: Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!
",9,1,9
"1956","Bender: Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? [The staff grumble. Bender closes his eyes.] In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic: 1000101010101...
",9,1,9
"1957","Bender: ...0010110012. Amen.
",9,1,9
"1958","Fry: Does that mean we can eat now?
",9,1,9
"1959","Bender: Yes. [The crew tuck in.] But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!
",9,1,9
"1960","Fry: Oh, uh, but I don't want to.
",9,1,9
"1961","Bender: Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend! [Fry, unsure, pats Bender on the back. Bender stands up again.] Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls.
",9,1,9
"1962","Leela: What are you doing to my ship?
",9,1,9
"1963","Bender: Sanctifying it! [Leela sighs. Bender has stuck on a robot version of the Ichthus.] There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
",9,1,9
"1964","Fry: Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
",9,1,9
"1965","Leela: Amen.
",9,1,9
"1966","Farnsworth: If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
",9,1,9
"1967","Fry: We've got to get the old Bender back.
",9,1,9
"1968","Leela: And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze"".
",9,1,9
"1969","Bender: I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
",9,1,9
"1970","Fry: Uh, this.
",9,1,9
"1971","Bender: Where are we delivering it to?
",9,1,9
"1972","Leela: Uh, here.
",9,1,9
"1973","Bender: Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
",9,1,9
"1974","Fry: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?
",9,1,9
"1975","Leela: Hey, great idea!
",9,1,9
"1976","Bender: But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
",9,1,9
"1977","Fry: Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine.
",9,1,9
"1978","Bender: What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
",9,1,9
"1979","Leela: Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.
",9,1,9
"1980","Bender: Thou shalt not snatch.
",9,1,9
"1981","Fry: And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
",9,1,9
"1982","Hookerbot: Hey, sailing unit!
",9,1,9
"1983","Bender: Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
",9,1,9
"1984","Fry: Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out.
",9,1,9
"1985","Leela: Go nuts.
",9,1,9
"1986","Hookerbot: Live a little.
",9,1,9
"1987","Woman: Could you hold my purse for a minute?
",9,1,9
"1988","Fry: Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!
",9,1,9
"1989","Bender: Well...
",9,1,9
"1990","Bender: I'm the greatest. [He opens the woman's purse and throws money into the air.] Woo-hoo!
",9,1,9
"1991","Fry: Look's like we got the old Bender back!
",9,1,9
"1992","Bender: You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing.
",9,1,9
"1993","Bender: Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes. [The Fembots laugh. There is a knock at the door.] Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign? [He wraps a towel around his waist and opens the door. A red glows comes from the corridor. Bender gasps.] No! No!
",9,1,9
"1994","Robot Devil: Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot Hell.
",9,1,9
"1995","Leela: What in hell happened to Bender?
",9,1,9
"1996","Fry: Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here. [Nibbler yelps.] Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench.
",9,1,9
"1997","Bender: I'm hallucinating this, right?
",9,1,9
"1998","Robot Devil: No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. Here's our brochure.
",9,1,9
"1999","Bender: But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
",9,1,9
"2000","Robot Devil: Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when you joined our religion. If you sin you go to Robot Hell, for all eternity.
",9,1,9
"2001","Bender: Aw, hell-- I mean ""heck""!
",9,1,9
"2002","Robot Devil: It's alright, you can say that here.
",9,1,9
"2003","Fry: Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
",9,1,9
"2004","Leela: Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
",9,1,9
"2005","Fry: Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell.
",9,1,9
"2006","Leela: Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
",9,1,9
"2007","Fry: Actually--
",9,1,9
"2008","Robot Devil: We know all your sins, Bender. And for each one we've prepared an agonising and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?
",9,1,9
"2009","Bender: Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?
",9,1,9
"2010","Robot Devil: [singing] Cigars are evil,
You won't miss 'em,
We'll find ways to simulate that smell,
What a sorry fella,
Rolled up and smoked like a panatela,
Here on level one of Robot Hell!
",9,1,9
"2011","Robot Devil: [singing] Gambling's wrong and so is cheating,
So is forging phoney IOU's,
Let's let Lady Luck decide,
What type of torture's justified,
I'm pit boss here on level two!
",9,1,9
"2012","Robot Devil: [talking] Ooh! Deep-fried robot!
",9,1,9
"2013","Bender: [singing] Just tell me why.
",9,1,9
"2014","Robot Devil: [singing] Please read this 55-page warrant.
",9,1,9
"2015","Bender: [singing] There must be robots worse than I.
",9,1,9
"2016","Robot Devil: [singing] We've checked around, there really aren't.
",9,1,9
"2017","Bender: [singing] Then please let me explain,
My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.
",9,1,9
"2018","Robot Devil: [singing] You stole from boy scouts, nuns and banks!
",9,1,9
"2019","Bender: [singing] Ah, don't blame me,
Blame my upbringing!
",9,1,9
"2020","Robot Devil: [singing] Please stop sinning while I'm singing!
",9,1,9
"2021","Robot Devil: [singing] Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,
Musicians need that income to survive.
",9,1,9
"2022","Beastie Boys: [singing] Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,
With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!
That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on level five!
",9,1,9
"2023","Fry: [singing] I don't feel well.
",9,1,9
"2024","Leela: [singing] It's up to us to rescue him.
",9,1,9
"2025","Fry: [singing] Maybe he likes it here in Hell.
",9,1,9
"2026","Leela: [singing] It's us who tempted him to sin.
",9,1,9
"2027","Fry: [singing] Maybe he's back at the motel.
",9,1,9
"2028","Leela: [singing] Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,
So just sit back, enjoy the ride.
",9,1,9
"2029","Fry: [singing] My ass has blisters from the slide.
",9,1,9
"2030","Robot Devil: [singing] Fencing diamonds,
Fixing cockfights,
Publishing indecent magazines,
",9,1,9
"2031","Robot Devil: You'll pay for every crime,
Knee-deep in electric slime,
You'll suffer till the end of time,
Enduring torture's, most of which rhyme,
Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!
",9,1,9
"2032","Robot Devil: [talking] Of course, that's just for starters.
",9,1,9
"2033","Fry: Bender, are you alright?
",9,1,9
"2034","Bender: No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing.
",9,1,9
"2035","Leela: Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?
",9,1,9
"2036","Robot Devil: Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll just sign this fiddle contest waiver.
",9,1,9
"2037","Leela: Wait. What fiddle contest?
",9,1,9
"2038","Robot Devil: The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires me to inform you that if you can best me in a fiddle contest, you win back Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold fiddle.
",9,1,9
"2039","Fry: Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
",9,1,9
"2040","Robot Devil: Well it's mostly for show.
",9,1,9
"2041","Leela: [whispering] Do you know how to play the fiddle?
",9,1,9
"2042","Fry: [whispering] No. Do you?
",9,1,9
"2043","Leela: [whispering] No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. [talking] What happens if we lose?
",9,1,9
"2044","Robot Devil: You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, him.
",9,1,9
"2045","Leela: We'll do it.
",9,1,9
"2046","Robot Devil: Very well, then. Beat this.
",9,1,9
"2047","Bender: Well, we're boned.
",9,1,9
"2048","Robot Devil: Your turn. [He hands the violin to Leela. She plays awfully. Fry and Bender cringe.] Ha!
",9,1,9
"2049","Leela: Time for the drum solo!
",9,1,9
"2050","Fry: Run!
",9,1,9
"2051","Robot Devil: Stop them! They cheated!
",9,1,9
"2052","Leela: Hurry, Bender!
",9,1,9
"2053","Bender: I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
",9,1,9
"2054","Leela: Oh, sorry.
",9,1,9
"2055","Bender: Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
",9,1,9
"2056","Leela: Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that.
",9,1,9
"2057","Bender: I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
",9,1,9
"2058","Fry: Good old Bender!
",9,1,9
"2059","Beastie Boys: Yeah, yeah! This one goes out to my man, Bender,
Sending this one out, special dedication,
To all my peoples in the robot homeworld,
Yeah, yeah! Big up with the Professor,
My man, Dr. Zoidberg,
I'd like to shout out-- a personal shout out to Leela,
Fry! My man, Bender,
Nibber, Nibbler, in the house,
Big shout out to all Futurama!
",9,1,9
"2060","Leela: That was the worst delivery ever.
",10,1,10
"2061","Fry: Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called ""Cannibalon""!
",10,1,10
"2062","Bender: Me neither. [upbeat] Food was good, though.
",10,1,10
"2063","Farnsworth: Oh, great news, everyone.
",10,1,10
"2064","Bender: Shove it! We quit!
",10,1,10
"2065","Farnsworth: In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
",10,1,10
"2066","Leela: Vacation?
",10,1,10
"2067","Bender: Alright!
",10,1,10
"2068","Fry: This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
",10,1,10
"2069","Farnsworth: It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
",10,1,10
"2070","Bender: Aww, you!
",10,1,10
"2071","Farnsworth: I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built. [He pulls out a brochure.] The Titanic!
",10,1,10
"2072","Leela: Looks nice.
",10,1,10
"2073","Fry: Hey, uh, where's my suitcase? [His suitcase flies out from the tube and knocks him over.] Ow!
",10,1,10
"2074","Poopenmeyer: As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure to introduce the honorary captain for the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who single-handedly defeated the Retiree People of the Assisted Living Nebula: Zapp Brannigan!

",10,1,10

",10,1,10

",10,1,10

",10,1,10
"2079","Zapp: She's a beautiful ship, alright. Shapely ... seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains out. [The crowd applauds. Zapp holds up his hand and they stop.] And now, without further adieu, I christen this ship, Titanic.
",10,1,10
"2080","Zapp: Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take notes, Kif. You're about to witness the subtle waltz known as seduction. [Kif sighs. Leela stops as Zapp blocks her way.] So, trapped on a ship with me. What say you and I knock some very sensual boots?
",10,1,10
"2081","Leela: It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ... [She repeatedly looks at Farnsworth, Zoidberg and Fry, makes a quick decision, then pulls Fry forward.] Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.
",10,1,10
"2082","Fry: Huh? [Leela eblows him.] Ooh! How do you do?
",10,1,10
"2083","Farnsworth: Ah, here's my stateroom.
",10,1,10
"2084","Bender: Come on, where is it?
",10,1,10
"2085","Farnsworth: Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife, LaBarbara, have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side.
",10,1,10
"2086","Fry: Man, first class seems nice!
",10,1,10
"2087","Farnsworth: It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
",10,1,10

",10,1,10
"2089","Leela: This is it.
",10,1,10
"2090","Fry: Well at least we get a window!
",10,1,10
"2091","Bender: Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!
",10,1,10
"2092","Amy: I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
",10,1,10

",10,1,10

"2101","Bender: Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
",10,1,10
"2102","iZac: You got it!
",10,1,10
"2103","Bender: Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
",10,1,10
"2104","Countess: Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. I was surprised to see another robot staying in first class. Most of the robots I meet are labourers.
",10,1,10
"2105","Bender: I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour"".
",10,1,10
"2106","Countess: Oh, Mr. Bender!
",10,1,10
"2107","Bender: Please, call me Bender.
",10,1,10
"2108","Countess: [embarrassed] Oh, goodness. I don't--
",10,1,10
"2109","Zapp: Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.
",10,1,10
"2110","Kif: I'll get the powder, sir.
",10,1,10
"2111","Zapp: No, the itch for adventure! Prepare to change course.
",10,1,10
"2112","Kif: Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path was set by the travel agency.
",10,1,10
"2113","Zapp: That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a route with some chest hair.
",10,1,10
"2114","Kif: But that course leads directly through a swarm of comets.
",10,1,10
"2115","Zapp: Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. By jack-knifing from one to the next at breakneck speed we might just get some kind of gravity boost ... or something. [Kif sighs.] It's time to shove a jalapeño up this ships tailpipe. [He grabs the wheel.] Divert power from the shields, full speed ahead!
",10,1,10
"2116","Amy: Oh, yeah!
",10,1,10
"2117","Mrs. Wong: Amy! Hello!
",10,1,10
"2118","Amy: Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
",10,1,10
"2119","Mr. Wong: We were planning on enjoying a relaxing vacation. But since you're here, we'll have to do some meddling.
",10,1,10
"2120","Mrs. Wong: We met the nicest boy in the cabin next to ours.
",10,1,10
"2121","Mr. Wong: He's not very ugly.
",10,1,10
"2122","Mrs. Wong: You should marry him! Or at least use him to conceive a grandchild for us.
",10,1,10
"2123","Mr. Wong: There he is at the buffet!
",10,1,10
"2124","Amy: Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend.
",10,1,10
"2125","Mrs. Wong: Really? Where is he?
",10,1,10
"2126","Mr. Wong: And why isn't he here right now fathering our grandchild?
",10,1,10
"2127","Amy: Uh...
",10,1,10
"2128","Leela: Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here.
",10,1,10
"2129","Fry: Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!
",10,1,10
"2130","Leela: Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fiancé thing was a terrible, terrible--
",10,1,10
"2131","Fry: Hmm? Mmm!
",10,1,10
"2132","Zapp: Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time but if things don't work out with this pipsqueak here ... [He puts his hand on her shoulder.] ... I just want you to know I'll be there to score you on the rebound.
",10,1,10
"2133","Leela: Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
",10,1,10
"2134","Fry: Well, you got anything else for him?
",10,1,10
"2135","Leela: Alright, can we try not to complicate this?
",10,1,10
"2136","Amy: Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend.
",10,1,10
"2137","Fry: Hmm? Mmm!
",10,1,10
"2138","Fry: See you later, wuvvums!
",10,1,10
"2139","Leela: It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
",10,1,10
"2140","Fry: I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?
",10,1,10
"2141","Leela: What? No. No! Of course not!
",10,1,10
"2142","Fry: Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.
",10,1,10
"2143","Countess: Mind if I freshen up a bit before we go out?
",10,1,10
"2144","Bender: I was just about to suggest the same thing. [The Countess giggles then disappears into the bathroom. The sound of a power tool comes from the room. Bender rubs his hands with glee. He rummages through her drawers and sees a bracelet on the table. He picks it up and chuckles.] Pay dirt!
",10,1,10
"2145","Countess: Lovely, isn't it?
",10,1,10
"2146","Bender: Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
",10,1,10
"2147","Countess: Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing error or you're the most romantic robot I've ever met!
",10,1,10
"2148","Bender: I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?
",10,1,10
"2149","iZac: It's obvious, Mr. B. You're in love.
",10,1,10
"2150","Bender: Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe.
",10,1,10
"2151","iZac: Hey, you gonna pay for those?
",10,1,10
"2152","Bender: Hell, no!
",10,1,10
"2153","iZac: Security to bar area. Security to bar area.
",10,1,10
"2154","Bender: Fellas, please. I'm in love!
",10,1,10
"2155","iZac: Rough him up!
",10,1,10
"2156","Countess: What are you doing?
",10,1,10
"2157","iZac: This penniless chump was stealing drinks, ma'am.
",10,1,10
"2158","Countess: I see. Here you are, sir. [She hands iZac some money.] Keep the change.
",10,1,10
"2159","iZac: You got it!
",10,1,10
"2160","Zoidberg: Aha!
",10,1,10
"2161","Fry: Go, Professor!
",10,1,10
"2162","Amy: Lean back more!
",10,1,10
"2163","Farnsworth: Ow!
",10,1,10
"2164","LaBarbara: Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo all of these people!
",10,1,10
"2165","Hermes: Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened.
",10,1,10
"2166","Announcer: [on loudspeaker] Now limbo-ing for the Earth team, Hermes Conrad.
",10,1,10
"2167","Boy: [shouting] You're my hero, Hermes! I'm gonna be just like you!
",10,1,10
"2168","Hermes: No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!
",10,1,10
"2169","Boy: I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--
",10,1,10
"2170","Hermes: [screaming] Nooo!
",10,1,10
"2171","LaBarbara: There, there. Now you don't have to limbo if you don't want. It doesn't make you any less of a man.
",10,1,10
"2172","Farnsworth: Though it did get me some action!
",10,1,10
"2173","Hattie: I like a man who's flexible!
",10,1,10
"2174","Zapp: Your attention, please. As captain of this vessel, the terrible burden of naming a limbo contest winner is mine and mine alone.
",10,1,10
"2175","Kif: Shouldn't you be steering between the comets?
",10,1,10
"2176","Zapp: And the winner is, Leela!
",10,1,10
"2177","Leela: But I didn't even limbo.
",10,1,10
"2178","Zapp: No matter. I know from personal experience how horizontal you can get. As your reward, you and that hairpile are invited to dine at the captain's table this evening.
",10,1,10
"2179","Bender: Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic.
",10,1,10
"2180","Countess: Bender, I don't care whether you have money. I love you for your artificial intelligence and your sincerity simulator.
",10,1,10
"2181","Bender: You do? Really?
",10,1,10
"2182","Zapp: I like your style, Fry. You remind me of a young me. Not much younger, mind you. Perhaps even a couple of years older.
",10,1,10
"2183","Fry: Thank you, sir.
",10,1,10
"2184","Zapp: As a gentleman, I must warn you. If you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be all over Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
",10,1,10
"2185","Fry: Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me.
",10,1,10
"2186","Amy: Hey, Fry.
",10,1,10
"2187","Leela: Amy!
",10,1,10
"2188","Amy: Leela!
",10,1,10
"2189","Zapp: Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.
",10,1,10
"2190","Leela: [whispering] What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
",10,1,10
"2191","Fry: [whispering] Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
",10,1,10
"2192","Zapp: I'd like to impose a toast on the happy couple. Down the hatch!
",10,1,10
"2193","Mrs. Wong: Hear, hear! Now let's have a kiss!
",10,1,10
"2194","Zapp: Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.
",10,1,10
"2195","Fry: Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--
",10,1,10
"2196","Mr. Wong: What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter already!
",10,1,10
"2197","Farnsworth: Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?
",10,1,10
"2198","Fry: Uh...
",10,1,10
"2199","Kif: Captain, may I have a word with you?
",10,1,10
"2200","Zapp: No.
",10,1,10
"2201","Kif: It's an emergency, sir.
",10,1,10
"2202","Zapp: Come back when it's a catastrophe. [There is a crash and the ship shakes. Zapp reluctantly stands up.] Oh, very well.
",10,1,10
"2203","Amy: Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss.
",10,1,10
"2204","Fry: Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy.
",10,1,10
"2205","Kif: Sir, remember your course correction?
",10,1,10
"2206","Zapp: No.
",10,1,10
"2207","Kif: Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we'd initially hoped.
",10,1,10
"2208","Zapp: Kif, old friend, I don't know which disgusts me more: Your cowardice or your stupidity! We'll simply set a new course for that empty region over there. Near that black-ish hole-ish thing.
",10,1,10
"2209","Fry: Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?
",10,1,10
"2210","Leela: I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
",10,1,10
"2211","Fry: Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you.
",10,1,10
"2212","Leela: Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes.
",10,1,10
"2213","Fry: I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her.
",10,1,10
"2214","Leela: Nice nebula.
",10,1,10
"2215","Fry: Yeah.
",10,1,10
"2216","Leela: Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
",10,1,10
"2217","Fry: And me.
",10,1,10
"2218","Leela: What was that? [She looks over the railings and sees.] Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole.
",10,1,10
"2219","Fry: Talk about a mood killer!
",10,1,10
"2220","Zapp: Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. Nothing remains now but for the captain to go down with his ship.
",10,1,10
"2221","Kif: Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
",10,1,10
"2222","Zapp: No, it's noble of you, Kif! [He tears his captain's patch off.] As of now ... [He puts the patch on Kif.] ... you're in command. Congratulations, captain!
",10,1,10
"2223","Leela: OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
",10,1,10
"2224","Farnsworth: [shouting] I'm too young to die!
",10,1,10
"2225","Leela: Come on, before it's too late!
",10,1,10
"2226","Bender: You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal.
",10,1,10
"2227","Fry: You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?
",10,1,10
"2228","Bender: [whispering] Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
",10,1,10
"2229","Fry: I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
",10,1,10
"2230","Bender: I love you, buddy!
",10,1,10
"2231","Bender: [shouting] Countess? Countess?
",10,1,10
"2232","Countess: [shouting] Bender!
",10,1,10
"2233","Countess: [shouting] I fell through the deck.
",10,1,10
"2234","Bender: [shouting] Are you hurt, my sweet?
",10,1,10
"2235","Countess: [shouting] No. Luckily a family broke my fall.
",10,1,10
"2236","Bender: Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
",10,1,10
"2237","Countess: Bender, you risked your life to save me.
",10,1,10
"2238","Bender: And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it. [They kiss.] When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water.
",10,1,10
"2239","Leela: Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
",10,1,10
"2240","Hermes: [gasping] Faster!
",10,1,10
"2241","Leela: It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
",10,1,10
"2242","Fry: Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
",10,1,10
"2243","Hermes: No one, except a legendary limbo champion.
",10,1,10
"2244","LaBarbara: Oh, Hermes!
",10,1,10
"2245","Hermes: Ooh! It's been a while. [He leans back and tries to go under the door. His knees hit it.] This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.
",10,1,10
"2246","LaBarbara: That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!
",10,1,10
"2247","Hermes: I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch.
",10,1,10
"2248","LaBarbara: Just go on through and hit the release, you hot dog!
",10,1,10
"2249","Hermes: Yes, dear.
",10,1,10
"2250","LaBarbara: That's my man!
",10,1,10
"2251","Amy: Yay, Hermes!
",10,1,10
"2252","Hermes: Uh, can somebody help me up?
",10,1,10
"2253","Countess: Well, now what are we going to do?
",10,1,10
"2254","Bender: Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
",10,1,10
"2255","Countess: By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 yacht.
",10,1,10
"2256","Farnsworth: Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.
",10,1,10
"2257","Leela: We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
",10,1,10
"2258","Mrs. Wong: Amy!
",10,1,10
"2259","Amy: Mom? Dad? You're alive!
",10,1,10
"2260","Mr. Wong: Yeah, but so what? The important thing is we found you a new man.
",10,1,10
"2261","Mrs. Wong: A captain.
",10,1,10
"2262","Amy: Uh, Mom, I don't-- [Enter Kif.] Hi!
",10,1,10
"2263","Kif: [sexfully] Hello!
",10,1,10
"2264","Farnsworth: I don't feel well!
",10,1,10
"2265","Fry: Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost-- [The nebula is sucked into the black hole.] Never mind!
",10,1,10
"2266","Hermes: Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
",10,1,10
"2267","Leela: I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
",10,1,10
"2268","Fry: Goodbye, Bender.
",10,1,10
"2269","Bender: [shouting] Wait for us!
",10,1,10
"2270","Leela: Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
",10,1,10
"2271","Amy: Well, it's not me!
",10,1,10
"2272","Fry: Look!
",10,1,10
"2273","Countess: I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too strong!
",10,1,10
"2274","Bender: I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!
",10,1,10
"2275","Countess: No! You have too much to live for. It may hurt for a while but one day you'll share your love again. After all, it's shareware.
",10,1,10
"2276","Bender: Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
",10,1,10
"2277","Countess: [shouting] Farewell!
",10,1,10
"2278","Bender: [shouting] No!
",10,1,10
"2279","Bender: She's gone.
",10,1,10
"2280","Leela: But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away.
",10,1,10
"2281","Fry: Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?
",10,1,10
"2282","Farnsworth: Oh, yes, absolutely! [He turns to Zoidberg.] Not a chance!
",10,1,10
"2283","Bender: At least I'll always have her bracelet! [He hands it to Hermes.] What do you think it's worth?
",10,1,10
"2284","Hermes: It's fake, mon!
",10,1,10
"2285","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. [He presses a button on the trolley and it lowers itself to the floor.] We've got a very special delivery today.
",11,1,11
"2286","Fry: Who's it going to?
",11,1,11
"2287","Farnsworth: Me.
",11,1,11
"2288","Bender: Another job well done.
",11,1,11
"2289","Farnsworth: No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University. [He strokes the crate.] It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize.
",11,1,11
"2290","Leela: In what field?
",11,1,11
"2291","Farnsworth: I don't care, they all pay the same.
",11,1,11
"2292","Fry: Is it dangerous?
",11,1,11
"2293","Farnsworth: Oh, my, no. [Fry kicks the box and the thing inside starts growling and shaking the box. Fry runs and hides behind Leela. Farnsworth pulls a tranquiliser gun out of nowhere and loads a tranquiliser dart into it. He pokes the gun through a hole in the crate and shoots whatever is inside. It whimpers and the shaking and growling stops.] Off we go!
",11,1,11
"2294","Fry: Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
",11,1,11
"2295","Farnsworth: Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636.
",11,1,11
"2296","Leela: They planted traditional college foliage; ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed.
",11,1,11
"2297","Fry: Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
",11,1,11
"2298","Farnsworth: Of course.
",11,1,11
"2299","Farnsworth: Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western Universe.
",11,1,11
"2300","Bender: [pointing] Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho.
",11,1,11
"2301","Leela: You went to college?
",11,1,11
"2302","Bender: Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending.
",11,1,11
"2303","Fry: What was your minor?
",11,1,11
"2304","Bender: Robo-American Studies.
",11,1,11
"2305","Fratbot #1: Are you here to fumigate the moose head?
",11,1,11
"2306","Bender: Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back.
",11,1,11
"2307","Fratbot #1: Eh, close enough. C'mon in.
",11,1,11
"2308","Bender: Thanks. Here's your finger back.
",11,1,11
"2309","Bender: All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
",11,1,11
"2310","Fratbot #2: Mate in 143 moves.
",11,1,11
"2311","Fratbot #3: Oh, pooh. You win again!
",11,1,11
"2312","Bender: Uh-oh, nerds!
",11,1,11
"2313","Fratbot #1: Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, chapter president. This is Oily, and this here is Fat-bot.
",11,1,11
"2314","Bender: You're all losers. My name's Bender.
",11,1,11
"2315","Oily: Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, you're a legend around here!
",11,1,11
"2316","Fat-bot: I heard that in one single night you drank a whole keg, streaked across campus and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.
",11,1,11
"2317","Bender: [modest] Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going.
",11,1,11
"2318","Gearshift: No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat on campus. Even Hillel has better parties than us. Please, you've gotta stay and teach us how to be cool.
",11,1,11
"2319","Bender: Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.
",11,1,11
"2320","Fat-bot: Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
",11,1,11
"2321","Fry: I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days.

"2324","Fry: Good old Coney Island College! Go, Whitefish!
",11,1,11
"2325","Leela: Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type.
",11,1,11
"2326","Fry: Oh, yeah? [He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket with ""Notice of Failure to Graduate"" written on it. The CICC logo is a Ferris wheel.] Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout.
",11,1,11
"2327","Leela: Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
",11,1,11
"2328","Farnsworth: That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout.
",11,1,11
"2329","Fry: What? That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!
",11,1,11
"2330","Leela: You won't last two weeks.
",11,1,11
"2331","Fry: Aww, thanks for believing in me.
",11,1,11
"2332","Amy: Yo, classmate. What you takin'?
",11,1,11
"2333","Fry: Oh, I don't know. [Farnsworth walks past with his crate on a hover trolley.] Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?
",11,1,11
"2334","Farnsworth: Same thing I teach every semester: The Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
",11,1,11
"2335","Fry: [writing] Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. [He points his pencil at Farnsworth.] I'll be there!
",11,1,11
"2336","Farnsworth: Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!
",11,1,11
"2337","Fry: See you in class!
",11,1,11
"2338","Farnsworth: Oh!
",11,1,11
"2339","Fat-bot: This is gonna be great!
",11,1,11
"2340","Bender: [from outside] Bingo!
",11,1,11
"2341","Fat-bot: [from outside] Oh, mama!
",11,1,11
"2342","Bender: [from outside] Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! [The girl takes the front of the Mac revealing the circuits inside. The fratbots gasp.] Get a load of that!
",11,1,11
"2343","Meiderneyer: I say, you've damaged our servants' quarters ... and our servants.
",11,1,11
"2344","Chet: This time Robot House has gone too far.
",11,1,11
"2345","Bender: Cheese it!
",11,1,11
"2346","Fat-bot: [screaming] They're gonna catch us!
",11,1,11
"2347","Fry: Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds. [There is a knock at the door.] A woodpecker.
",11,1,11
"2348","Leela: I think that's probably your roommate.
",11,1,11
"2349","Fry: Oh, right, cool. [shouting] C'mon in, roomie! [He opens the door but there is no one there. He looks down and sees a monkey wearing a bowler hat and carrying two cases.] [talking] What the--?
",11,1,11
"2350","Monkey: I call top bunk!
",11,1,11
"2351","Fry: My roommate's a monkey?
",11,1,11
"2352","Monkey: [sarcastic] Brilliant deduction, you're a credit to your species.
",11,1,11
"2353","Farnsworth: Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!
",11,1,11
"2354","Fry: You know each other?
",11,1,11
"2355","Farnsworth: Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
",11,1,11
"2356","Guenter: I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork.
",11,1,11
"2357","Leela: So what makes Guenter talk?
",11,1,11
"2358","Fry: Is he genetically engineered?
",11,1,11
"2359","Farnsworth: Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation.
",11,1,11
"2360","Guenter: You're wasting your breath, Professor. He'll never understand a word of it.
",11,1,11
"2361","Fry: I understood the word ""hat""!
",11,1,11
"2362","Farnsworth: Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason: So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up.
",11,1,11
"2363","Fry: You want a banana?
",11,1,11
"2364","Guenter: I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured energy bars made from tofu.
",11,1,11
"2365","Fry: I don't like you.
",11,1,11
"2366","Fry: This is gonna be a cakewalk!
",11,1,11
"2367","Teacher: Welcome to the history of the 20th century. Look to your left, then to your right. Then in nine other directions. One of the 12 of you will not pass this class.
",11,1,11
"2368","Amy: Boring. [She leans over to Guenter.] Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
",11,1,11
"2369","Teacher: Be forewarned: The only sure way to get an A in this class is to have lived in the 20th century.
",11,1,11
"2370","Fry: Swish!
",11,1,11
"2371","Teacher: You were saying, Mr. Fry?
",11,1,11
"2372","Fry: I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything.
",11,1,11
"2373","Teacher: Very well. What device invented in the 20th century allowed people to view broadcast programmes in their own homes?
",11,1,11
"2374","Fry: Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
",11,1,11
"2375","Guenter: I believe the answer is the television.
",11,1,11
"2376","Teacher: Very good, Mr. ... [He checks his list.] ... Guenter.
",11,1,11
"2377","Amy: [impressed] Wow! Smart and cute!
",11,1,11
"2378","Vernon: What I love about being dean of students is the peace and quiet and the respect I receive. [The phone rings.] Now what's all this about?
",11,1,11
"2379","Woman: [on phone] Dean Vernon, the students from Robot House are here.
",11,1,11
"2380","Vernon: Robot House!
",11,1,11
"2381","Bender: Hey, dean, nice looking model.
",11,1,11
"2382","Vernon: You keep away from it. You robots are a disgrace to this university. Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House. Whenever a human corpse is desecrated--
",11,1,11
"2383","Bender: Now, I can explain that.
",11,1,11
"2384","Vernon: That's enough out of you. From this day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret probation!
",11,1,11
"2385","Bender: No fair!
",11,1,11
"2386","Fat-bot: My mom is gonna kill me!
",11,1,11
"2387","Vernon: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the one thing that's kept me sane these past eight years: My model ship.
",11,1,11
"2388","Gearshift: Fat-bot! No!
",11,1,11
"2389","Fat-bot: When I get nervous I get hungry.
",11,1,11
"2390","Bender: Cheese it!
",11,1,11
"2391","Vernon: [shouting; from inside] Robot House!
",11,1,11
"2392","Fry: So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?
",11,1,11
"2393","Chrissy: Not even if you were the last man on Mars.
",11,1,11
"2394","Guenter: [shouting] Hey! You like bananas?
",11,1,11
"2395","Guenter: [shouting; from outside] I got her number. How do you like them bananas?
",11,1,11
"2396","Farnsworth: And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade.
",11,1,11
"2397","Fry: Sorry, I overslept.
",11,1,11
"2398","Farnsworth: Until 5pm?
",11,1,11
"2399","Fry: It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
",11,1,11
"2400","Farnsworth: Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you.
",11,1,11
"2401","Fry: I hate that rodent!
",11,1,11
"2402","Farnsworth: Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered.
",11,1,11
"2403","Fry: That'll show him.
",11,1,11
"2404","Amy: Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez.
",11,1,11
"2405","Vernon: Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we could admit Amy in exchange for your generous contribution.
",11,1,11
"2406","Mr. Wong: How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?
",11,1,11
"2407","Vernon: How much you got?
",11,1,11
"2408","Guenter: Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study session ... with Chrissy!
",11,1,11
"2409","Farnsworth: Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you.
",11,1,11
"2410","Guenter: [horrified] Mom? Dad? What are you doing here? [The monkeys start jumping around and shaking the cage bars. The other guests stare and Guenter covers his eyes.] This is so humiliating.
",11,1,11
"2411","Fry: Now these monkeys I like! [The monkeys chomp the bananas and jump around again.] What's that? You wanna come out?
",11,1,11
"2412","Guenter: No! Stop!
",11,1,11
"2413","Chet: I say.
",11,1,11
"2414","Farnsworth: What's that they're flinging at us?
",11,1,11
"2415","Guenter: Oh, dear Lord! All over the dean!
",11,1,11
"2416","Fry: Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?
",11,1,11
"2417","Bender: Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action.
",11,1,11
"2418","Fat-bot: It's my first time, I'm really nervous.
",11,1,11
"2419","Vernon: [shouting] Robot House!
",11,1,11
"2420","Leela: What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
",11,1,11
"2421","Fry: You mean peer pressure?
",11,1,11
"2422","Fry: Look out! He's got a gun!
",11,1,11
"2423","Guenter: [crying] Leave me alone.
",11,1,11
"2424","Leela: Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas.
",11,1,11
"2425","Guenter: [crying] Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in but seeing my parents act like that made me realise I'm just a primitive beast.
",11,1,11
"2426","Fry: Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest, hard-working people.
",11,1,11
"2427","Leela: Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat.
",11,1,11
"2428","Guenter: [crying] So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't make me happy.
",11,1,11
"2429","Leela: That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
",11,1,11
"2430","Guenter: [crying] They can't. It's all the hat.
",11,1,11
"2431","Fry: Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle.
",11,1,11
"2432","Guenter: The jungle. But I couldn't do that to the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, and he's like a father to me.
",11,1,11
"2433","Leela: But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
",11,1,11
"2434","Farnsworth: Look at him. I'm so proud.
",11,1,11
"2435","Fry: Thanks, Professor!
",11,1,11
"2436","Farnsworth: Not you.
",11,1,11
"2437","Fry: [screaming] Ow!
",11,1,11
"2438","Student: Hey!
",11,1,11
"2439","Farnsworth: Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?
",11,1,11
"2440","Farnsworth: [crying] Oh, poor Guenter.
",11,1,11
"2441","Leela: So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
",11,1,11
"2442","Farnsworth: I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
",11,1,11
"2443","Fry: I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
",11,1,11
"2444","Farnsworth: You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
",11,1,11
"2445","Fry: Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment!
",11,1,11
"2446","Farnsworth: But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela.
",11,1,11
"2447","Leela: Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion: What we should do is...
",11,1,11
"2448","Farnsworth: What?
",11,1,11
"2449","Leela: I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
",11,1,11
"2450","Farnsworth: What?
",11,1,11
"2451","Vernon: You all know the rules. Whichever house wins the regatta becomes head of the Greek Council. And should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation, it will be lifted and I will be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honouring them.
",11,1,11
"2452","Chet: I say, Robot House, your water craft is as ill-designed as you yourselves.
",11,1,11
"2453","Meiderneyer: Good one, Chet!
",11,1,11
"2454","Bender: Oh, yeah? Watch this!
",11,1,11
"2455","Chet: Well, I never!
",11,1,11
"2456","Vernon: Fraternities, on your marks.
",11,1,11
"2457","Bender: Hey!
",11,1,11
"2458","Fry: Wow! The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
",11,1,11
"2459","Farnsworth: Jungles? On Earth?
",11,1,11
"2460","Leela: I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
",11,1,11
"2461","Farnsworth: Stand back.
",11,1,11
"2462","Leela: Oops.
",11,1,11
"2463","Farnsworth: Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
",11,1,11
"2464","Fry: There's our man!
",11,1,11
"2465","Leela: Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. [She holds out the hat and banana and they take them.] We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal.
",11,1,11
"2466","Farnsworth: Come on, Guenter, take the hat.
",11,1,11
"2467","Fry: No, the banana, the banana!
",11,1,11
"2468","Farnsworth: Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
",11,1,11
"2469","Fry: Banana, banana, banana!
",11,1,11
"2470","Leela: Wait, what's that sound?
",11,1,11
"2471","Gearshift: [shouting] Hey, Bender, you sure this is a short-cut?
",11,1,11
"2472","Bender: [shouting] Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
",11,1,11
"2473","Vernon: And the winner is ... [The fratbots appear and walk across the finish line with their raft draped around them.] ... Robot House?
",11,1,11
"2474","Farnsworth: Oh, dear Lord!
",11,1,11
"2475","Leela: No! No!
",11,1,11
"2476","Farnsworth: Thank God this log is sturdy. [He pats it and a bit breaks off and plunges over the edge. On the riverbank, Guenter finds the hat and banana and sniffs them both.] [shouting] Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us! [Guenter puts the banana on his head and tries to eat the hat.] [muttering] Stupid monkey.
",11,1,11
"2477","Fry: [shouting] No.
",11,1,11
"2478","Leela: [shouting] Not there.
",11,1,11
"2479","Farnsworth: [shouting] Keep trying.
",11,1,11
"2480","Guenter: Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's all so obvious now!
",11,1,11
"2481","Leela: [shouting] Help us, Guenter!
",11,1,11
"2482","Guenter: Oh, my goodness. [shouting] Hang on. I need to do some calculations. [He picks up the banana and draws some diagrams in the soft mud.] Got it! [He ties some vines around another log and pushes it into the river. He jumps onto it, floats down the river and throws the vine over an overhead branch. The other end dangles near the others.] Grab on!
",11,1,11
"2483","Farnsworth: We're saved!
",11,1,11
"2484","Fry: 'Preciate it, Guenter!
",11,1,11
"2485","Leela: Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself.
",11,1,11
"2486","Guenter: Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius, and as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt. [Fry chuckles.] [sadly] There's just no place for me in this world. [normal] Although, on the other hand--
",11,1,11
"2487","Farnsworth: Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well, let's go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste.
",11,1,11
"2488","Fry: Guenter! You're alive!
",11,1,11
"2489","Guenter: I guess the hat must have broke my fall.
",11,1,11
"2490","Farnsworth: It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it.
",11,1,11
"2491","Guenter: No, wait! I like it like this. I actually feel sort of happy.
",11,1,11
"2492","Farnsworth: But what about your super-intelligence?
",11,1,11
"2493","Guenter: When I had that there was too much pressure to use it. All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided to transfer to business school!
",11,1,11
"2494","Farnsworth: [screaming] Nooo!
",11,1,11
"2495","Bender: [shouting] Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!
",11,1,11
"2496","Fry: Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?
",12,1,12
"2497","Technician: Well, it's a Fox affiliate.

",12,1,12
"2499","Technician: Single Female Lawyer. It's the season finale. Wanna watch?
",12,1,12

"2509","Stenographer: [on TV] Could you repeat that last par--

"2521","Fry: [unenthusiastic] Eh, I think I'll just stay here.
",12,1,12
"2522","Leela: Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world.
",12,1,12
"2523","Fry: But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
",12,1,12
"2524","Leela: Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.

"2528","Fry: Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!
",12,1,12
"2529","Leela: They are now. In the 2600's, New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments.

"2538","Amy: No, Nibbler! [Nibbler runs off with the burger and her bikini top. She gasps and covers herself with the burger buns.] [whispering] Psst, Professor, I need another bikini.
",12,1,12
"2539","Farnsworth: Eh ... wha? [He sees her.] Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left. [He reaches into a bag next to him and takes out a spray can and hands it to her. She sprays it over her making a brand new pink bikini.] Oh, my.
",12,1,12
"2540","Amy: There. How do I look?
",12,1,12
"2541","Farnsworth: Like a cheap French harlot.
",12,1,12
"2542","Amy: French?
",12,1,12
"2543","Bully: Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make time with a real man?
",12,1,12
"2544","Leela: No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ... [He flexes his muscles.] ... handsome they are.
",12,1,12
"2545","Fry: It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do.
",12,1,12
"2546","Bully: Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.
",12,1,12
"2547","Fry: 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
",12,1,12
"2548","Leela: Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
",12,1,12
"2549","Bully: Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay.
",12,1,12
"2550","Zoidberg: Uh-oh. [A lobster pot traps him.] Help! Help! [He knocks on the trap. Bender wanders by, whistling.] Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!
",12,1,12
"2551","Bender: Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. [He bends the bars and spotlights shine on the pair and alarms beep.] Cheese it!
",12,1,12
"2552","Fry: Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in, if he were a fiddler crab.
",12,1,12
"2553","Leela: It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
",12,1,12
"2554","Fry: Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?
",12,1,12
"2555","Bender: Right here, buddy. [His left eyelid covers his left eye and his right eye zooms out. The rest of the staff kneel next to the castle.] Wait, I wanna be in the picture too. [He takes his head off and puts it on the ground. He pushes his antenna down and it flashes like a timer. His body joins the staff.] Pretend you're happy.
",12,1,12
"2556","Zoidberg: Yay!
",12,1,12
"2557","Leela: Oh, my God!
",12,1,12
"2558","Hermes: What in Babylon?
",12,1,12
"2559","Fry: [screaming] Nooo!
",12,1,12
"2560","Hermes: Faster!
",12,1,12
"2561","Fry: We're all gonna die, aren't we?
",12,1,12
"2562","Farnsworth: Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously. [chuffed] Oh, yes!
",12,1,12
"2563","Linda: [on TV] Once again, today's winning lotto number was 4. In other news, alien saucers continue to rain destruction upon Earth. We now go live to an emergency address by Earth President McNeal.
",12,1,12
"2564","McNeal: [on TV] Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear. The time has come to knuckle under. To get down on all fours and really lick boot. Give our alien masters whatever they want a--
",12,1,12
"2565","Lrrr: [on TV] People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8. [He taps the mic and turns to his aides.] Is this thing on? [He blows into it and turns back to the camera.] Now then: We want the one you call ""McNeal"". Give us McNeal or we will lay waste to your cities with our anti-monument laser. We demand McNeal!
",12,1,12
"2566","McNeal: [on TV] Uh, as I was saying ... [He clears his throat.] ... mankind would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever he is. Am I right? [The representatives murmur to each other.] And now, the man who will lead us in our proud struggle for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 25-star General Zapp Brannigan!
",12,1,12
"2567","Man: [cheering; on TV] Yeah!
",12,1,12
"2568","Bender: Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with.
",12,1,12
"2569","Leela: The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
",12,1,12
"2570","Bender: Evidently not.
",12,1,12
"2571","Zapp: [on TV] Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill, I haven't met him and killed him yet. But I can't go it alone. [He looks into the camera.] That's why I'm ordering every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly into the air.
",12,1,12
"2572","Leela: Well, you heard the windbag: We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship.
",12,1,12
"2573","Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.
",12,1,12
"2574","Fry: A what?
",12,1,12
"2575","Bender: You know, a coward.
",12,1,12
"2576","Zapp: [on TV] Since this is an emergency, all robots will now have their patriotism circuits activated.
",12,1,12
"2577","Bender: It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity. [His antenna stops flashing.] Oh, crap!
",12,1,12
"2578","Zapp: We're all from different cultures here. Some of you are white, some of you are black. [He stops by a man and points at him.] You're brown. [He moves on to Bender.] And you're silver. But I don't care if your skin's red or tan or Chinese. You're all going to have to learn to die together. [He looks back at Bender.] Am I right, soldier?
",12,1,12
"2579","Bender: Well, actually, I-- [Zapp presses the remote again and Bender's antenna flashes and beeps.] Sir, yes, sir! Sir!
",12,1,12
"2580","Zapp: Remember, our mission is simple: Destroy all aliens!
",12,1,12
"2581","Kif: Um, uh, not me, sir.
",12,1,12
"2582","Zapp: Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif. [quietly] Unless you have to. [He sees Leela.] [talking] Oh, ho, ho! The luscious Captain Leela. [He starts rubbing his hands.] This is turning into one very sex-ay struggle for the future of the human race!
",12,1,12
"2583","Leela: Thanks, but I'm not technically human.
",12,1,12
"2584","Zapp: Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either.
",12,1,12
"2585","Zapp: The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well-made bed. You will practise until you can make your bed in your sleep.
",12,1,12
"2586","Fry: You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
",12,1,12
"2587","Zapp: You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. Not with all the bed-making you'll be doing.
",12,1,12
"2588","Zapp: The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. [Kif sighs and turns to a computer.] Now, like all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command, all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with wreckage.
",12,1,12
"2589","Fry: W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
",12,1,12
"2590","Bender: Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. [His antenna stops flashing and he bangs his head with his knuckles.] Aw, cut it out!
",12,1,12
"2591","Zapp: You're a brave robot, son. But when I'm in command every mission's a suicide mission. Which reminds me. [He walks over to where Leela is sitting and puts his foot on the seat next to her. She folds her arms and isn't impressed.] Leela, perhaps before we head into battle you'd like to make love to me, in case one of us doesn't come back.
",12,1,12
"2592","Leela: Maybe we should wait till afterwards, in case neither of us comes back.
",12,1,12
"2593","Zapp: Here's hoping.
",12,1,12
"2594","Fry: I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!
",12,1,12
"2595","Leela: [on screen] Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?
",12,1,12
"2596","Fry: Sure, I just like TV better.
",12,1,12
"2597","Leela: Bender, damage report.
",12,1,12
"2598","Bender: The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail.
",12,1,12
"2599","Fry: Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!
",12,1,12
"2600","Leela: We did it! We won!
",12,1,12
"2601","Bender: [sadly] Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini. [He opens his chest cabinet.] [normal] Well, who wants a martini?
",12,1,12
"2602","Zapp: [on screen] Good work, everyone. The mothership is destroyed.
",12,1,12
"2603","Zapp: What the hell is that thing?
",12,1,12
"2604","Kif: It appears to be the mothership.
",12,1,12
"2605","Zapp: Then what did we just blow up?
",12,1,12
"2606","Kif: The Hubble Telescope.
",12,1,12
"2607","Zapp: [shouting] Stop exploding, you cowards!
",12,1,12
"2608","Leela: This is hopeless. [She runs to the pilot's seat and sits down.] If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home.
",12,1,12
"2609","Farnsworth: You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed-- [The door behind him opens and the real crew walk in.] Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive! [He turns back to the others.] Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most.
",12,1,12
"2610","Lrrr: [on TV] We want McNeal! Stop stalling!
",12,1,12
"2611","Linda: [on TV] And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.
",12,1,12
"2612","McNeal: [on TV] The people of Earth remain united in my refusal to hand over myself. Total annihilation is a small price to pay compared with--
",12,1,12
"2613","Zapp: [shouting] Here he is! Come and get him!
",12,1,12
"2614","Lrrr: You are not McNeal.
",12,1,12
"2615","Zapp: [simultaneous] Huh?
",12,1,12
"2616","McNeal: [simultaneous] Huh?
",12,1,12
"2617","Nd-Nd: You are not the one we want.
",12,1,12
"2618","McNeal: [grovelling] Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious masters! I--
",12,1,12
"2619","Lrrr: Give us McNeal!
",12,1,12
"2620","Zapp: That was McNeal.
",12,1,12
"2621","Nd-Nd: No, McNeal, the single female lawyer.
",12,1,12
"2622","Lrrr: She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.
",12,1,12
"2623","Zapp: [sexfully] Really?
",12,1,12
"2624","Fry: Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
",12,1,12
"2625","Lrrr: Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.
",12,1,12
"2626","Zapp: Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
",12,1,12
"2627","Lrrr: [shouting] Silence! [talking] We will accept no more decoys. [He holds up a headshot of the single female lawyer.] This is the McNeal.
",12,1,12
"2628","Fry: Wait, I know her.
",12,1,12
"2629","Leela: You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV.
",12,1,12
"2630","Fry: That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer.
",12,1,12
"2631","Bender: Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pft, they are royally boned.
",12,1,12
"2632","Lrrr: [on TV] We will raise your planet's temperature by one million degrees a day, for five days, unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow -- 8 central!
",12,1,12
"2633","Farnsworth: [disappointed] I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
",12,1,12
"2634","Leela: They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
",12,1,12
"2635","Fry: It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
",12,1,12
"2636","Farnsworth: Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--
",12,1,12
"2637","Fry: Magic. Got it.
",12,1,12
"2638","Amy: Check this out: Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.
",12,1,12
"2639","Fry: Beer-- I would think.
",12,1,12
"2640","Bender: They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
",12,1,12
"2641","Amy: There aren't any copies left.
",12,1,12
"2642","Farnsworth: No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus.
",12,1,12
"2643","Fry: Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.
",12,1,12
"2644","Zoidberg: I could make the costumes.
",12,1,12
"2645","Farnsworth: I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
",12,1,12
"2646","Bender: [dramatically] And I, I could be an acting coach!
",12,1,12
"2647","Fry: Let's put on a show.
",12,1,12
"2648","Fry: OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
",12,1,12
"2649","Leela: Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays.
",12,1,12
"2650","Amy: Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt.
",12,1,12
"2651","Leela: Gimme the script.

"2652","Fry: Places, everyone.
",12,1,12
"2653","Amy: OK ... all set!

"2655","Lrrr: Prepare the water cooler, that we may gather around it later and discuss things.

Fighting for her client,[He swaps the sign to one that says ""Written and Directed by Fry"".]
Wearing sexy miniskirts,

(talking) Hey, I'm pretty good!
",12,1,12
"2658","Farnsworth: Uh ... [reading] ... Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ... [At the side of the set Fry watches on a TV screen that Bender is hooked up to. Bender scratches himself.] ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?
",12,1,12
"2659","Leela: [reading] Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury.
",12,1,12
"2660","Hermes: [sexfully] I'll see you during the recess!
",12,1,12
"2661","Lrrr: If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously why does she not simply tear the judge's head off?

"2662","Nd-Nd: It is true what they say; ""Women are from Omicron Persei 7, men are from Omicron Persei 9"".
",12,1,12

",12,1,12
"2664","Zoidberg: Gracias. [He stands up with his script behind him and walks over to the witness box where Leela is sat.] Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?

",12,1,12

",12,1,12
"2667","Leela: Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court... [whispering] Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue.
",12,1,12
"2668","Fry: Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read.
",12,1,12
"2669","Leela: What are we supposed to do now?
",12,1,12
"2670","Fry: I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force.

"2672","Farnsworth: [reading] What say you, Single Female Lawyer?

",12,1,12
"2677","Leela: Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.
",12,1,12
"2678","Fry: But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared.
",12,1,12
"2679","Lrrr: [on TV] : Attention, McNeal. Your unexpected marriage plan scares us. You stole our hearts as a single female lawyer, and so shall you remain -- or else!
",12,1,12
"2680","Fry: You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
",12,1,12
"2681","Bender: [à la Arnold Jackson] Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?
",12,1,12
"2682","Fry: Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I had gone outside. Now just read these cue cards.
",12,1,12
"2683","Fry: And action!
",12,1,12
"2684","Farnsworth: [reading] Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead.

",12,1,12
"2696","Fry: Yep. [He turns the TV on, sits down on the couch and puts his feet up on the table.] It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows: At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal.

"2725","Zoidberg: Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine. [He turns to the rest of the staff.] [muttering] Oh boy. [quietly] I didn't have the heart to tell him: It's fin fungus. He'll be floating upside-down by morning.
",13,1,13
"2726","Amy: You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc.
",13,1,13
"2727","Bender: I'm 40% zinc.
",13,1,13
"2728","Amy: Then take some Echinacea or a St. John's wort.
",13,1,13
"2729","Farnsworth: Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
",13,1,13
"2730","Leela: Hey, what's rattling around in there?
",13,1,13
"2731","Farnsworth: It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!
",13,1,13
"2732","Farnsworth: I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything, even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles. [Amy, Hermes, Fry and Leela put on some goggles and gasp when they see Farnsworth putting on a full-body radiation suit. He picks up the F-ray and turns to Bender.] You may feel a slight stinging sensation -- all of you! [The crew look shocked and Farnsworth turns on the F-ray and shines it on Bender's casing. He adjusts it and the beam lights up Bender's inner workings. Farnsworth points the beam at Bender's head showing his CPU number, 6502, then he points it at his arms, feet and back to his body. A watch has jammed Bender's workings.] Aha! There's the cause of your illness.
",13,1,13
"2733","Amy: Hey, that's my watch!
",13,1,13
"2734","Bender: I was wondering where I put that. [He puts his hand down his throat and hands Amy her watch through his door. He turns from the reddish colour back to his normal blue-grey colour.] Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.
",13,1,13
"2735","Farnsworth: Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands.
",13,1,13
"2736","Bender: What should we point it at first?
",13,1,13
"2737","Fry: I 'unno. Try it on me. [Bender turns it on and points it at Fry's crotch. Fry doubles over in pain.] Ow! My sperm!
",13,1,13
"2738","Bender: Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?
",13,1,13
"2739","Fry: Huh, didn't hurt that time.
",13,1,13
"2740","Bender: Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.
",13,1,13
"2741","Fry: What's wrong?
",13,1,13
"2742","Bender: That's no lady!

"2745","""Fembot"": You couldn't afford it, honey.
",13,1,13
"2746","Fry: All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty. [He sees a stack of Slurm cans in the corner. Next to them is a life-sized cardboard stand-up of Slurms MacKenzie and the babes. A speech bubble comes from Slurms' mouth with ""Win A Party With Me"" written on it. Fry picks up a can.] Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside.
",13,1,13
"2747","Bender: Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things.
",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2749","Bender: Ah, this thing stinks.
",13,1,13
"2750","Fry: We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk. [He points behind him to a cart full of Slurm merchandise including Slurm coats, a cooler of Slurm cans, eight Slurm blernsball caps, a Slurm motorbike and a Slurm jet-ski.] I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty.
",13,1,13
"2751","Leela: Fry, are you alright?

",13,1,13

",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2762","Slurms: Right!
",13,1,13
"2763","Glurmo: In fact, Slurms has to party all night, every night, or he's fired!

",13,1,13
"2765","Glurmo: But before the party, you're all in for a fun-derful treat: A VIP tour of the Slurm factory!
",13,1,13
"2766","Slurms: Enjoy the tour, dudes! [The leave and he droops over.] I'm gonna go lie down.

"2769","Bender: Look! Flowers! And a boat!
",13,1,13
"2770","Farnsworth: Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
",13,1,13
"2771","Glurmo: Why, those are the Grunka Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
",13,1,13
"2772","Farnsworth: Tell them I hate them.
",13,1,13
"2773","Glurmo: As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll see our mix-ologists at work. [He points to some Grunka Lunkas stirring cauldrons of yellow-orange stuff.] They take 900 of the finest ingredients, add a touch of child-like delight and mix it all with glacial spring water from our glacial spring water generator. [He points to a Grunka Lunka pumping water into a bucket from two containers labelled ""H2"" and ""O"".] Then, last of all, we add the secret ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously addictive.
",13,1,13
"2774","Fry: So, what's the secret ingredient?
",13,1,13
"2775","Glurmo: It's whatever your imagination wants it to be.
",13,1,13
"2776","Fry: Oh. But what is it really?
",13,1,13
"2777","Glurmo: [sternly] That's not for you to know. [normal] Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas are inducing Wumpus berries to release their flavour, using sensual massage.
",13,1,13

",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2781","Glurmo: Yes.
",13,1,13

",13,1,13

",13,1,13

",13,1,13

",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2794","Glurmo: [from boat] I heard that!
",13,1,13
"2795","Glurmo: Now, on your right, you'll see the Slurm Master checking the Slurm for colour and bouquet.
",13,1,13
"2796","Fry: So thirsty.
",13,1,13
"2797","Glurmo: Then he tastes it. He tastes it and tastes it, then tastes it some more.
",13,1,13
"2798","Fry: Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?
",13,1,13
"2799","Glurmo: No food or drink allowed on the tour. You'll have to wait until you're partying with Slurms MacKenzie.
",13,1,13
"2800","Fry: When will that be?
",13,1,13
"2801","Glurmo: Soon enough.
",13,1,13
"2802","Fry: That's not soon enough.
",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2804","Glurmo: Nothing.
",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2806","Grunka Lunkas: [singing] Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient,
You should not ask about the secret ingredient.
",13,1,13
"2807","Bender: OK, OK, we get the point.
",13,1,13
"2808","Leela: I was just curious because of the armed guards.
",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2810","Bender: [shouting] Shut the hell up!
",13,1,13
"2811","Hermes: So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
",13,1,13
"2812","Glurmo: That's right. They think they have a good union but they don't. [whispering] They're basically slaves.
",13,1,13
"2813","Leela: What are you doing?
",13,1,13
"2814","Fry: I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
",13,1,13
"2815","Leela: No. That's moronic.
",13,1,13
"2816","Fry: Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. [He laughs and tumbles in. He waves his arms around.] Help! I can't swim!
",13,1,13
"2817","Leela: Bender, why did you jump in?
",13,1,13
"2818","Bender: Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.

"2819","Bender: Ow!
",13,1,13
"2820","Leela: Where are we?
",13,1,13
"2821","Bender: And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
",13,1,13
"2822","Fry: This isn't Slurm at all!
",13,1,13
"2823","Leela: Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
",13,1,13
"2824","Leela: This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
",13,1,13
"2825","Fry: My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
",13,1,13
"2826","Leela: No. There's already a soda like that: Soylent Cola.
",13,1,13
"2827","Fry: Oh. How is it?
",13,1,13
"2828","Leela: It varies from person to person.
",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2830","Zoidberg: Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?

",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2835","Fry: Look! Slurm! Finally! [He points at a conveyor belt with cans of Slurm on it. He walks over, picks up a can and drinks from it.] Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again.
",13,1,13
"2836","Leela: It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
",13,1,13
"2837","Fry: Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh. [He takes another swig.] Mmm, still warm.
",13,1,13
"2838","Fry: Ew!
",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2840","Bender: Oh, Lordy!
",13,1,13
"2841","Leela: Fry! [Fry realises what he is doing and spits the Slurm out and breathes a sigh of relief. Then he drinks some more.] Fry!
",13,1,13
"2842","Fry: That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
",13,1,13
"2843","Leela: That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
",13,1,13

",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2854","Leela: How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
",13,1,13
"2855","Slurm Queen: Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. Milk comes from a cow's behind. And have you ever used toothpaste?
",13,1,13

",13,1,13
"2886","Bender: Forget it, pal. [He holds up the ""You Win!"" cap.] It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us.

"2931","Zoidberg: [reluctant] Alright, I'm coming.
",14,2,1
"2932","Jeffery: Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper gets the suppository. [The woman leaves.] Next.
",14,2,1
"2933","Jeffery: It's just a simple broken fang, nothing serious.
",14,2,1
"2934","Bender: What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?
",14,2,1
"2935","Jeffery: No-- What? Huh?
",14,2,1
"2936","Bender: Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
",14,2,1
"2937","Leela: No!
",14,2,1
"2938","Bender: You about done?
",14,2,1
"2939","Leela: Next time I'm keeping it.
",14,2,1
"2940","Jeffery: OK, well I believe I have a replacement fang for your pet in the next room. [He walks through a door and doesn't close it. Fry, Leela and Bender step back in horror when they hear an animal growling. Jeffery struggles with the growling creature and glass breaks. He flails his legs around and runs back into the examination room. The door closes. His shirt is ripped and blooded and he has a bruised eye.] The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but luckily he knocked one of my teeth out. [He chuckles.] Now then.
",14,2,1
"2941","Fry: Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?
",14,2,1
"2942","Jeffery: Um, I'm still a little woozy from a gazelle kick this morning but if he's anything like the common tree, the rings might indicate his age.
",14,2,1
"2943","Fry: Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings.
",14,2,1
"2944","Jeffery: He's five.
",14,2,1
"2945","Farnsworth: Happy birthday, young Nibbler.
",14,2,1
"2946","Leela: Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!
",14,2,1
"2947","Bender: [sarcastic] I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
",14,2,1
"2948","Fry: Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
",14,2,1
"2949","Bender: Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. [He closes his eyes and uses his cheating unit to pinpoint the exact place the tail should go. He pins it on, opens his eyes and cheers.] And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?
",14,2,1
"2950","Amy: Hey, look at Nibbler!
",14,2,1
"2951","Hermes: Aww, he's holding a spoon.
",14,2,1
"2952","Zoidberg: He's so talented!
",14,2,1
"2953","Bender: You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime. [He takes off his head, whistles Sweet Georgia Brown and spins his head like a Globetrotter then reattaches it.] Ta-da!
",14,2,1
"2954","Hermes: Now he's wearing a hat!
",14,2,1
"2955","Leela: Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!
",14,2,1
"2956","All: [singing] What day is today?
It's Nibbler's birthday,
What a day for a birthday,
Let's all have some cake.
",14,2,1
"2957","Fry: [singing] And you smell like one too!
",14,2,1
"2958","Bender: Hey, what about this?
",14,2,1
"2959","Leela: Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
",14,2,1
"2960","Bender: Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.
",14,2,1
"2961","Leela: Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
",14,2,1
"2962","Bender: So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget.
",14,2,1
"2963","Bender: That'll take care of those annoying rats. [He puts it back in the cupboard.] Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me.
",14,2,1
"2964","Bender: There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public. [He turns around and washes his hands. While his back is turned Nibbler hops around the worktops and starts sniffing the cake. Bender turns around and sees.] No! Get away from there! [Nibbler gobbles up the cake and Bender screams. Nibbler burps.] That's it.
",14,2,1
"2965","Bender: Happy birthday!
",14,2,1
"2966","Leela: Bender, what's going-- [She gasps when she sees Nibbler disappear.] [crying] No!
",14,2,1
"2967","Bender: Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
",14,2,1
"2968","Amy: Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
",14,2,1
"2969","Bender: Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?
",14,2,1
"2970","Leela: [crying] Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
",14,2,1
"2971","Bender: Only one way to find out.
",14,2,1
"2972","Leela: [crying] You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
",14,2,1
"2973","Bender: Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
",14,2,1
"2974","Leela: You do?
",14,2,1
"2975","Bender: Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady.
",14,2,1
"2976","Farnsworth: And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go: The toilet.
",14,2,1
"2977","Leela: [crying] I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
",14,2,1
"2978","Calculon: [on TV] Give it to me straight, doctor, don't sugarcoat it.
",14,2,1
"2979","Doctorbot: [on TV] Very well. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fiancée crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer.
",14,2,1
"2980","Bender: Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!
",14,2,1
"2981","Amy: It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
",14,2,1
"2982","Leela: I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
",14,2,1
"2983","Farnsworth: Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged.
",14,2,1
"2984","Fry: Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
",14,2,1
"2985","Linda: [on TV] The official death toll in that tragic rocket crash has now been raised to 54,000.
",14,2,1
"2986","Bender: Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?
",14,2,1
"2987","Farnsworth: I need to tinker in it.
",14,2,1
"2988","Bender: Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
",14,2,1
"2989","Farnsworth: Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip.
",14,2,1
"2990","Fry: And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
",14,2,1
"2991","Farnsworth: Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force"".
",14,2,1
"2992","Bender: Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow...
",14,2,1
"2993","Farnsworth: [hammering] Oh, dear. Oh, my. I got it. Once more.
",14,2,1
"2994","Bender: Ow! Professor!
",14,2,1
"2995","Farnsworth: [hammering] Steady now.
",14,2,1
"2996","Bender: Ow!
",14,2,1
"2997","Farnsworth: There we go. [He takes Bender's head out of the vice and rejoins it to his body.] Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
",14,2,1
"2998","Bender: My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
",14,2,1
"2999","Zoidberg: That's me, baby!
",14,2,1
"3000","Farnsworth: Hmm.
",14,2,1
"3001","Bender: Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her.
",14,2,1
"3002","Amy: Uh ... that's me.
",14,2,1
"3003","Fry: [whispering] Thanks for covering.
",14,2,1
"3004","Bender: This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
",14,2,1
"3005","Amy: Bingo!
",14,2,1
"3006","Hermes: That's Leela!
",14,2,1
"3007","Leela: Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain.
",14,2,1
"3008","Bender: Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
",14,2,1
"3009","Leela: I'm not mopey. You shut up!
",14,2,1
"3010","Bender: Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!
",14,2,1
"3011","Leela: Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already.
",14,2,1
"3012","Amy: Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy.
",14,2,1
"3013","Leela: A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
",14,2,1
"3014","Fry: What's your problem?
",14,2,1
"3015","Bender: [crying] I miss Nibbler.
",14,2,1
"3016","Fry: You do?
",14,2,1
"3017","Bender: Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. [He picks up a bottle of Olde Fortran.] Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?
",14,2,1
"3018","Bender: Uh-oh, jealousy. [He stands up and points at Fry.] [shouting] You think you're so hot!
",14,2,1
"3019","Fry: What?
",14,2,1
"3020","Bender: The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
",14,2,1
"3021","Fry: [crying] They're just responding to my personality.
",14,2,1
"3022","Amy: Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?
",14,2,1
"3023","Leela: [theatrical happiness] Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
",14,2,1
"3024","Bender: [crying] I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream. [He walks off.] [crying] A bucket of--
",14,2,1
"3025","Fry: [shouting] The spoon's in the foot powder.
",14,2,1
"3026","Bender: I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.
",14,2,1
"3027","Fry: Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers.
",14,2,1
"3028","Bender: Really?
",14,2,1
"3029","Fry: Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
",14,2,1
"3030","Bender: Hmm, sewers. [He scratches his chin.] Thinking, thinking, thinking.
",14,2,1
"3031","Bender: Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. [He flushes the toilet but doesn't go anywhere.] Damn, it's too small. [He climbs out of it.] What did those human design this for anyway? [He disconnects his left arm, drops it down the toilet and flushes it away.] Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! [He spins his head off and flushes it.] See you on the other side!
",14,2,1
"3032","Fry: Bender? Bender?
",14,2,1
"3033","Fry: Have you seen my sombrero?
",14,2,1
"3034","Leela: Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
",14,2,1
"3035","Fry: Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad.
",14,2,1
"3036","Leela: You're right. I feel terrible.
",14,2,1
"3037","Fry: Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!
",14,2,1
"3038","Leela: I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
",14,2,1
"3039","Amy: Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
",14,2,1
"3040","Zoidberg: They're hideous!
",14,2,1
"3041","Leela: There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
",14,2,1
"3042","Farnsworth: Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive run-off and good old American faeces!
",14,2,1
"3043","Fry: God bless America.
",14,2,1
"3044","Fry: Phew! Uh, ladies first.
",14,2,1
"3045","Fry: Oh, and the aftertaste!
",14,2,1
"3046","Leela: What is it?
",14,2,1
"3047","Fry: I burned my finger.
",14,2,1
"3048","Leela: OK, check the guidebook.
",14,2,1
"3049","Fry: Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met.
",14,2,1
"3050","Leela: Wait, what's that?
",14,2,1
"3051","Bender: I never should have thrown out the manual.
",14,2,1
"3052","Leela: Bender, you didn't have to come down here.
",14,2,1
"3053","Bender: I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
",14,2,1
"3054","Leela: [crying] He was so cute.
",14,2,1
"3055","Bender: [crying] He was so sweet.
",14,2,1
"3056","Fry: Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous. [He points the torch at something in the water.] Or maybe it's whatever that is.
",14,2,1
"3057","Leela: [shouting] Nibbler?
",14,2,1
"3058","Bender: [shouting] Nibbler?
",14,2,1
"3059","Leela: It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?
",14,2,1
"3060","Fry: Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe. [He points his torch at an extremely thin pipe. Bender and Leela glare at him.] Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile.
",14,2,1
"3061","Leela: [simultaneous] Idiot.
",14,2,1
"3062","Bender: [simultaneous] Idiot.
",14,2,1
"3063","Fry: OK, OK, never mind. I'll just ask those people for directions.
",14,2,1
"3064","Leela: [shouting] Mutants!
",14,2,1
"3065","Leela: Mutants! They're real!
",14,2,1
"3066","Fry: I'll take care of this! [He sets the end of the guidebook alight and points it at the mutants.] Back! Back!
",14,2,1
"3067","Vyolet: Thanks, handsome.
",14,2,1
"3068","Dwayne: Please, do not be frightened, we're harmless.
",14,2,1
"3069","Raoul: I have three arms.
",14,2,1
"3070","Dwayne: I said ""harmless"" not ""armless"".
",14,2,1
"3071","Vyolet: Lay off him. You know he's only got one ear.
",14,2,1
"3072","Fry: Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants.
",14,2,1
"3073","Dwayne: Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the mutants.
",14,2,1
"3074","Vyolet: Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a mirror lately?
",14,2,1
"3075","Raoul: Welcome to our village. It may not be Paris but it has a certain quaint charm that I, for one, wouldn't trade for the world.
",14,2,1
"3076","Bender: You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?
",14,2,1
"3077","Dwayne: Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you.
",14,2,1
"3078","Leela: No, we're on the top.
",14,2,1
"3079","Fry: Daylight and everything.
",14,2,1
"3080","Vyolet: It must be wonderful.
",14,2,1
"3081","Bender: Eh.
",14,2,1
"3082","Leela: Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet.
",14,2,1
"3083","Raoul: Well if he got flushed down the toilet he probably came through here. Everything always does. Follow me. [He opens an umbrella and Fry, Leela and Bender follow him, covering themselves.] All that is ours was once flushed down your toilets. Over there is our aquarium. [He points at a fish tank with eight fish and a yellow bird floating dead on the top.] This is our library.
",14,2,1
"3084","Bender: Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
",14,2,1
"3085","Raoul: And over here is our church.
",14,2,1
"3086","Fry: Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
",14,2,1
"3087","Vyolet: Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's mainly a Christmas and Easter thing.
",14,2,1
"3088","Leela: [shouting] Nibbler?
",14,2,1
"3089","Bender: [shouting] Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.
",14,2,1
"3090","Fry: So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?
",14,2,1
"3091","Vyolet: No. That's just an urban legend.
",14,2,1
"3092","Bender: [pointing] Then what are those?
",14,2,1
"3093","Vyolet: Crocodiles.
",14,2,1
"3094","Raoul: We keep them as pets. Then, when they grow too large, we flush them down into the sub-sewer.
",14,2,1
"3095","Dwayne: Some say there's a freakish race of sub-mutants down there.
",14,2,1
"3096","Vyolet: Please, that's just a sub-urban legend.
",14,2,1
"3097","Dwayne: Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe in ... [He snatches Fry's torch and shines it under his chin, emphasising his hideous-ness.] ... El Chupanibre.
",14,2,1
"3098","Leela: El Chupanibre? What's that?
",14,2,1
"3099","Dwayne: Gather round, children, for the legend of El Chupanibre.
(singing) He creeps and crawls in the midnight hush,
Silent as a low-flow toilet flush,
Watch your step,
'Cause sooner or later,
He'll eat you whole,
And half your alligator.
",14,2,1
"3100","Vyolet: Crocodile.
",14,2,1
"3101","Dwayne: Whatever.
",14,2,1
"3102","Leela: Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
",14,2,1
"3103","Bender: Hey, yeah!
",14,2,1
"3104","Raoul: You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.
",14,2,1
"3105","Leela: You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
",14,2,1
"3106","Dwayne: Impossible. If the legend is true, our only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice.
",14,2,1
"3107","Raoul: Yes. An unspoiled virgin.
",14,2,1
"3108","Leela: [raising her hand] I volunteer.
",14,2,1
"3109","Vyolet: Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen Zapp Brannigan's webpage.
",14,2,1
"3110","Bender: Oh, I made myself feel bad.
",14,2,1
"3111","Raoul: She'll have to do. Chain her to the post! [Dwayne padlocks the chains around Leela. She stands under a shaft of light and faces a long, wide sewer pipe.] And rip her shirt a little. [Dwayne tears it a little and walks away.] Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for the, uh, ""virgin"", he will be snared by this rope trap.
",14,2,1
"3112","Dwayne: [quietly] Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. It is nightfall.
",14,2,1
"3113","Leela: Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
",14,2,1
"3114","Dwayne: The tide is coming in.
",14,2,1
"3115","Vyolet: Quiet! The beast approaches.
",14,2,1
"3116","Bender: Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious! [He picks up Nibbler.] Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
",14,2,1
"3117","Dwayne: That's not El Chupanibre.
",14,2,1
"3118","Bender: Say what?
",14,2,1
"3119","Dwayne: That's El Chupanibre.
",14,2,1
"3120","Fry: I'll take care of this.
",14,2,1
"3121","Leela: Bender, do something.
",14,2,1
"3122","Bender: I'm too scared.
",14,2,1
"3123","Fry: Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!
",14,2,1
"3124","Leela: I can't. I love every living creature.
",14,2,1
"3125","Fry: Even me?
",14,2,1
"3126","Leela: As a friend.
",14,2,1
"3127","Fry: Damn.
",14,2,1
"3128","Bender: Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you.
",14,2,1
"3129","Leela: Well, I could use a new tank top.
",14,2,1
"3130","Bender: Bigger! Bigger!
",14,2,1
"3131","Leela: A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
",14,2,1
"3132","Bender: Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit.
",14,2,1
"3133","Leela: Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
",14,2,1
"3134","Bender: Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
",14,2,1
"3135","Fry: Bender's gonna be killed!
",14,2,1
"3136","Leela: You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
",14,2,1
"3137","Fry: [cheering] Yeah!
",14,2,1
"3138","Leela: You did it!
",14,2,1
"3139","Raoul: Let's have a tissue-tape parade!
",14,2,1
"3140","Bender: No, thanks!
",14,2,1
"3141","Dwayne: Gather round, children, to hear the legend of Bender.[He strums the guitar.]
(singing) He came from above with a--[A string snaps and he sighs.]
(talking) It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another guitar string.
",14,2,1
"3142","Farnsworth: That was a disgusting story.
",14,2,1
"3143","Leela: And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender.
",14,2,1
"3144","Bender: I love you too. [He turns to Farnsworth.] Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
",14,2,1
"3145","Farnsworth: Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own.
",14,2,1
"3146","Fry: Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
",14,2,1
"3147","Farnsworth: No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity.
",14,2,1
"3148","Bender: And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!
",14,2,1
"3149","Leela: You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him. [She stands up and heads for the door.] [shouting] So long, jerkwads!
",14,2,1
"3150","Farnsworth: [waving] So long!
",14,2,1
"3151","Fry: Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. [His knight charges at the bishop and the bishop batters it to the ground with his crook. The horse pulls out a dagger, stabs the bishop and kicks him off the game board. Fry chuckles and reclines in his seat.] Check.
",15,2,2
"3152","Bender: Hmm. Get him, boys!
",15,2,2
"3153","Fry: [hoarse] Good move.
",15,2,2
"3154","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. [Hermes walks in behind him carrying a package.] We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace.
",15,2,2
"3155","Bender: Nope. Watching cartoons.
",15,2,2
"3156","Fry: Sorry.
",15,2,2
"3157","Leela: What's the mission?
",15,2,2
"3158","Farnsworth: It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
",15,2,2
"3159","Fry: DOOP? What's that?
",15,2,2
"3160","Farnsworth: It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry.
",15,2,2
"3161","Fry: Uh...
",15,2,2
"3162","Hermes: Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
",15,2,2
"3163","Fry: [getting it] Oh!
",15,2,2
"3164","Farnsworth: Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
",15,2,2
"3165","Leela: What are we delivering?
",15,2,2
"3166","Farnsworth: Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
",15,2,2
"3167","Leela: We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
",15,2,2
"3168","Farnsworth: Alright, but don't run with them.
",15,2,2
"3169","Fry: Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!
",15,2,2
"3170","Glab: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's magnificent new headquarters. A fitting home for an organisation that has fostered peace throughout the universe. Even between the Insectoids and the Space Lizards.
",15,2,2
"3171","Fry: So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?
",15,2,2
"3172","Amazonian: Big rats there. Me crush with club.
",15,2,2
"3173","Fry: That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
",15,2,2
"3174","Glab: I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet. [She turns to the grey man.] What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?
",15,2,2
"3175","Neutral President: I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
",15,2,2
"3176","Zapp: I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With enemies you know where they stand but with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens me. [Kif sighs. Fry, Leela and Bender walk past with the scissors and Zapp stops them.] Halt. [They gasp.] Why, Leela, I do believe we've met.
",15,2,2
"3177","Bender: [whispering] He means you guys did it.
",15,2,2
"3178","Leela: If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.
",15,2,2
"3179","Zapp: Then you're under arrest.
",15,2,2
"3180","Leela: What for?
",15,2,2
"3181","Zapp: How do I know these scissors aren't part of some Neutral plot?
",15,2,2
"3182","Leela: But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
",15,2,2
"3183","Zapp: The Yarn People of Nylar 4? [He points at the pink creatures made of yarn.] So, a plan to assassinate a weird-looking alien with scissors. How very Neutral of you.
",15,2,2
"3184","Leela: What?
",15,2,2
"3185","Zapp: It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. [Kif sighs.] Search them for paper, and bring me a rock.
",15,2,2
"3186","Kif: Why?
",15,2,2
"3187","Zapp: So beautiful, yet so neutral. [He grabs her arms and handcuffs them behind her back.] Drag them to the ship.
",15,2,2
"3188","Glab: And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary DOOP captain who just returned from a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 7, Zapp Brannigan.
",15,2,2
"3189","Zapp: What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?
",15,2,2
"3190","Kif: Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting the ribbon right now.
",15,2,2
"3191","Zapp: No matter. I'll simply cut it from here with the ship's laser.
",15,2,2
"3192","Kif: Sir, I don't think that's wise.
",15,2,2
"3193","Zapp: Kif, if there's one thing I don't need it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise attitude.
",15,2,2
"3194","Zapp: Whoopsie-daisy!
",15,2,2
"3195","Glab: Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do you plead?
",15,2,2
"3196","Zapp: Absolutely 99% not guilty.
",15,2,2
"3197","Glab: Then the prosecutor will call his first witness.
",15,2,2
"3198","Hyper-Chicken: Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken from a backwoods asteroid but if it please the court I reckon I'll call the entire jury.
",15,2,2
"3199","Glab: I'm going to allow this.
",15,2,2
"3200","Hyper-Chicken: Members of the jury ... [He pecks the floor.] ... did y'all happen to catch a gander at who blew up that there DOOP headquarters?
",15,2,2
"3201","Juror #1: [simultaneous] That's the guy, right there.
",15,2,2
"3202","Juror #2: [simultaneous] Oh, yeah, right there.
",15,2,2
"3203","Small Glurmo #1: [simultaneous] That one.
",15,2,2
"3204","Hyper-Chicken: And are y'all gonna vote to convict him?
",15,2,2
"3205","Neptunian: [simultaneous] You'd better believe it.
",15,2,2
"3206","Juror #1: [simultaneous] You bet.
",15,2,2
"3207","Glab: The jury is instructed to disregard its own testimony.
",15,2,2
"3208","Hyper-Chicken: Your Honour, the prosecution rests.
",15,2,2
"3209","Glab: The evidence against Zapp Brannigan is strong. However, in light of his years of service, and the incompetence of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid I must dismiss all charges.
",15,2,2
"3210","Leela: Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify.
",15,2,2
"3211","Glab: I'm going to allow this.
",15,2,2
"3212","Hyper-Chicken: Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, were you or were you not wearing a hoop skirt?
",15,2,2
"3213","Leela: That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye.
",15,2,2
"3214","Zapp: I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
",15,2,2
"3215","Glab: I'm going to allow this.
",15,2,2
"3216","Zapp: We've met before have we not?
",15,2,2
"3217","Leela: [reluctantly] Yes.
",15,2,2
"3218","Zapp: And on that occasion, did you have sex with someone? May I remind you you are still under oath.
",15,2,2
"3219","Leela: [reluctantly] Yes.
",15,2,2
"3220","Zapp: Please point out the person in this courtroom you had sex with. [Leela points at him and Fry hoots.] And his name is?
",15,2,2
"3221","Leela: Zapp Brannigan.
",15,2,2
"3222","Zapp: The very same Zapp Brannigan who did not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case.
",15,2,2
"3223","Glab: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may begin your deliberations.
",15,2,2
"3224","Small Glurmo #1: Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant ... guilty.
",15,2,2
"3225","Glab: Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped of your rank as captain and dismissed from the DOOP.
",15,2,2
"3226","Zapp: I'd like to make one final statement. Kif, c'mere and hold up the flag. [Kif scurries past him and holds up the DOOP flag behind him.] And wave it a little, for God's sakes. My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault.
",15,2,2
"3227","Kif: What?
",15,2,2
"3228","Glab: Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged.
",15,2,2
"3229","Zapp: One day a man has everything, the next day he blows up a $400 billion space station and the next day he has nothing. It makes you think.
",15,2,2
"3230","Kif: No, it doesn't.
",15,2,2
"3231","Zapp: Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life as civilians. [He walks off and Kif doesn't follow.] That's an order, soldier.
",15,2,2
"3232","Fry: Hey, Bender?
",15,2,2
"3233","Bender: Yeah?
",15,2,2
"3234","Leela: Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to.
",15,2,2
"3235","Fry: You don't have to get so mad, Leela.
",15,2,2
"3236","Bender: Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger.
",15,2,2
"3237","Leela: Zapp?
",15,2,2
"3238","Zapp: Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. You're the only woman who ever loved me.
",15,2,2
"3239","Leela: I never loved you.
",15,2,2
"3240","Zapp: I mean physically.
",15,2,2
"3241","Leela: What do you want?
",15,2,2
"3242","Zapp: Just let me work for a little food. Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service you sexually, or mop the floors.
",15,2,2
"3243","Leela: You don't know how to do any of those things.
",15,2,2
"3244","Zapp: Kif might.
",15,2,2
"3245","Farnsworth: Leela, who are you talking to?
",15,2,2
"3246","Zapp: Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. And his commanding officer.
",15,2,2
"3247","Farnsworth: Why, you're that disgraced starship captain. [He turns to Leela.] Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record. [He turns back to Zapp and Kif.] Come in.
",15,2,2
"3248","Farnsworth: I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. [He leans over to Hermes.] [whispering] Which ones are new?
",15,2,2
"3249","Hermes: The green dude and the fat man.
",15,2,2
"3250","Farnsworth: Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either.
",15,2,2
"3251","Bender: I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
",15,2,2
"3252","Farnsworth: Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. [He turns to Hermes and shrugs.] Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy!
",15,2,2
"3253","Zapp: So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman but what manner of captain is she?
",15,2,2
"3254","Fry: She's really strict.
",15,2,2
"3255","Bender: And mean.
",15,2,2
"3256","Zapp: I see. Does she by any chance give the crewmembers spankings?
",15,2,2
"3257","Fry: No, she just makes us do work and stuff.
",15,2,2
"3258","Zapp: Good, good. But should she ever institute some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy, let me go in your place. I won't have my comrades harmed.
",15,2,2
"3259","Bender: Hey, this guy's alright!
",15,2,2
"3260","Zapp: Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man.
",15,2,2
"3261","Kif: I've computed out landing co-ordinates, Captain.
",15,2,2
"3262","Leela: Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.
",15,2,2
"3263","Kif: Wait, what?
",15,2,2
"3264","Leela: I said ""very nice work"".
",15,2,2
"3265","Kif: This is the happiest day of my life.
",15,2,2
"3266","Leela: OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.
",15,2,2
"3267","Bender: They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
",15,2,2
"3268","Leela: They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
",15,2,2
"3269","Fry: Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me.
",15,2,2
"3270","Leela: I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
",15,2,2
"3271","Bender: Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once.
",15,2,2
"3272","Fry: Yeah!
",15,2,2
"3273","Zapp: That's using the old noodle!
",15,2,2
"3274","Zapp: Come on, girdle. Hold!
",15,2,2
"3275","Bender: Uh-oh.
",15,2,2
"3276","Leela: What the hell happened?
",15,2,2
"3277","Bender: Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know.
",15,2,2
"3278","Leela: I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
",15,2,2
"3279","Fry: Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.
",15,2,2
"3280","Bender: I'll start loading up the pillows.
",15,2,2
"3281","Leela: No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand.
",15,2,2
"3282","Zapp: Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: Does the company that made your bra make a girdle as well? I ask because a friend of mine...
",15,2,2
"3283","Leela: Just get to work.
",15,2,2
"3284","Bender: [mocking] I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh.
",15,2,2
"3285","Fry: I agree.
",15,2,2
"3286","Kif: The point is, it's just so humiliating working for that man. Once, he actually ordered me to ... shave his armpits while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--
",15,2,2
"3287","Leela: Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?
",15,2,2
"3288","Kif: Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout then, um... OK, well, there he was in the tub, alright?
",15,2,2
"3289","Fry: Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off.
",15,2,2
"3290","Bender: This is all Leela's fault.
",15,2,2
"3291","Fry: Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now.
",15,2,2
"3292","Zapp: Y'know, boys, a good captain needs many skills, such as boldness, daring and a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced Leela has any of those things.
",15,2,2
"3293","Fry: Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much.
",15,2,2
"3294","Zapp: Back when I was captain all I asked from my men was their complete loyalty. If I had that, then for all I cared they could sit around the whole day drinking beer in their underpants.
",15,2,2
"3295","Bender: Beer?
",15,2,2
"3296","Fry: Underpants?
",15,2,2
"3297","Kif: But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free! [He laughs.] Oh, you hear that? I'm actually laughing!
",15,2,2
"3298","Fry: This is a mutiny.
",15,2,2
"3299","Bender: You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain.
",15,2,2
"3300","Fry: All hail the new captain.
",15,2,2
"3301","Zapp: Leela, you might be a formidable do-er of the nasty but I am forced to relieve you of your post.
",15,2,2
"3302","Leela: On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?
",15,2,2
"3303","Zapp: Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig.
",15,2,2
"3304","Fry: We don't have a brig.
",15,2,2
"3305","Zapp: Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as ""the brig"".
",15,2,2
"3306","Leela: You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
",15,2,2
"3307","Bender: You got it, genius.
",15,2,2
"3308","Leela: But, didn't I do a good job?
",15,2,2
"3309","Fry: You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
",15,2,2
"3310","Leela: Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends.
",15,2,2
"3311","Fry: Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then.
",15,2,2
"3312","Bender: Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh.
",15,2,2
"3313","Zapp: Back in my old uniform, and it nearly still fits. Even after all that fattening hobo cuisine.
",15,2,2
"3314","Kif: What shall I do with your civilian clothes, sir?
",15,2,2
"3315","Zapp: Take them to the laundry-brig. [Kif leaves. Zapp turns to Fry and Bender.] So, do I have your loyalty, men?
",15,2,2
"3316","Bender: [saluting] To the ends of the universe.
",15,2,2
"3317","Fry: Ten hundred percent!
",15,2,2
"3318","Zapp: That's not nearly loyal enough. I order you to sit around and drink beer until you're as loyal as Kif here.
",15,2,2
"3319","Bender: Yes, sir, sir!
",15,2,2
"3320","Kif: Um, may I have a beer, sir?
",15,2,2
"3321","Zapp: No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We will single-handedly attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.
",15,2,2
"3322","Kif: Oh, jeez.
",15,2,2
"3323","Zapp: Once the neutral war machine lies in ruins, I'll be a hero again and the DOOP will reinstate me as captain.
",15,2,2
"3324","Kif: But, sir, that plan makes no sense.
",15,2,2
"3325","Zapp: Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall correctly, you were court-martialled in disgrace.
",15,2,2
"3326","Fry: Ooh, burn!
",15,2,2
"3327","Bender: Nailed you, buddy!
",15,2,2
"3328","Zapp: Prepare to continue the epic struggle between good and neutral.
",15,2,2
"3329","Fry: This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ... [He screams and makes explosion noises.] ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like...
",15,2,2
"3330","Zapp: Precisely. Now, in the name of all that is good and honourable, we'll call the Neutral President with a message of peace, then blast him.
",15,2,2
"3331","Bender: [saluting] Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!
",15,2,2
"3332","Zapp: Fly the white flag of war.
",15,2,2
"3333","Zapp: [on screen] This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.
",15,2,2
"3334","Neutral President's Aide: Should we trust him, Your Neutralness?
",15,2,2
"3335","Neutral President: All I know is my gut says maybe.
",15,2,2
"3336","Bender: What now, chief?
",15,2,2
"3337","Zapp: Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, killing them in a hellish firestorm from which no living thing can escape.
",15,2,2
"3338","Fry: Good, good, then what?
",15,2,2
"3339","Zapp: Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, will have ejected to safety, wearing the only spacesuit on board.
",15,2,2
"3340","Fry: Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
",15,2,2
"3341","Zapp: Of course. What do you think I meant by ""loyalty""? Now help me into the only spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in there so you may need to apply baby powder.
",15,2,2
"3342","Fry: Leela, we want you to be captain again.
",15,2,2
"3343","Leela: Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? [They shake their heads and she puts the folded sheet on top of a pile.] He ran out of beer? [They shake their heads again.] So he's about to kill us?
",15,2,2
"3344","Fry: We want Leela to be captain again.
",15,2,2
"3345","Zapp: So it's mutiny, is it? I never thought I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. I found a children's spacesuit you can wear.
",15,2,2
"3346","Kif: To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here with Captain Leela. She actually listens to what I have to--
",15,2,2
"3347","Leela: Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. [The look ahead as they get closer to the planet.] We're gonna crash!
",15,2,2
"3348","Bender: Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo. [Fry smiles weakly.] And Fry.
",15,2,2
"3349","Leela: OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?
",15,2,2
"3350","Fry: Absolutely.
",15,2,2
"3351","Leela: Even if I make you work hard?
",15,2,2
"3352","Bender: As your God is my witness.
",15,2,2
"3353","Leela: Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
",15,2,2
"3354","Bender: Oh, man, that crap's heavy.
",15,2,2
"3355","Fry: And warm.
",15,2,2
"3356","Leela: Just do it.
",15,2,2
"3357","Neutral President's Aide: Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert.
",15,2,2
"3358","Neutral President: If I don't survive, tell my wife, ""Hello"".
",15,2,2
"3359","Leela: Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
",15,2,2
"3360","Bender: [on screen] Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it.
",15,2,2
"3361","Fry: It's too low.
",15,2,2
"3362","Bender: Quick.
",15,2,2
"3363","Leela: You did it! You actually did it!
",15,2,2
"3364","Fry: And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
",15,2,2
"3365","Zapp: And so, when Captain Leela panicked, perhaps distracted by female troubles, my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever I did to save the day.
",15,2,2
"3366","Glab: Captain Leela, is this rambling story of magic and heroism true?
",15,2,2
"3367","Leela: Well, actually--
",15,2,2
"3368","Farnsworth: [whispering] That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
",15,2,2

"3373","Kif: I-I'll call and tell you about it.

"3374","Fry: Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever.
",15,2,2
"3375","Bender: Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?
",15,2,2
"3376","Leela: No.

[A stopwatch and telephone fly past.] The kind of place where there might be a monster or some kind of weird mirror. [An old boot, a man shampooing his hair and a half-eaten drumstick fly past.] These are just examples. It could also be something much better. [A door rotates towards the camera in the centre of the picture.] Prepare to enter The Scary Door. [The door opens onto the titles, which shatter like glass. The show begins and the first scene is a pan over a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The camera glides past smoking rubble.] As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth.

"3384","Man: [on TV] Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity. [His glasses break.] It's not fair! It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books. [His eyes fall out and he screams.] It's not f-- Well, lucky I know how to read Braille! [His hands fall off and he screams. Then his tongue falls out and finally his head comes off.] Hey, look at that weird mirror!
",16,2,3
"3385","Bender: Cursed by his own hubris!
",16,2,3
"3386","Leela: There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!
",16,2,3
"3387","Bender: Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!
",16,2,3
"3388","Announcer: [voice-over; on TV] C-SPAN9 presents: The Thrill Of Politics.
",16,2,3
"3389","Leela: Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world.
",16,2,3
"3390","Fry: What do we care? We live in the United States.
",16,2,3
"3391","Leela: The United States is part of the world.
",16,2,3
"3392","Fry: Wow! I have been gone a long time.
",16,2,3
"3393","Johnson: [on TV] It's time someone had the courage to stand up and say: ""I'm against those things that everybody hates"".
",16,2,3
"3394","Jackson: [on TV] Now I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man but, quite frankly, I agree with everything he just said!
",16,2,3
"3395","Fry: These are the candidates? They sound like clones. [He looks a little harder.] Wait a minute. They are clones!
",16,2,3
"3396","Leela: Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
",16,2,3
"3397","Johnson: [on TV] I say your three cent titanium tax goes too far.
",16,2,3
"3398","Jackson: [on TV] And I say your three cent titanium tax doesn't go too far enough!
",16,2,3
"3399","Fry: If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown.
",16,2,3
"3400","Leela: You're not registered?
",16,2,3
"3401","Fry: Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference.
",16,2,3
"3402","Leela: That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.
",16,2,3
"3403","Bender: Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
",16,2,3
"3404","Farnsworth: But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
",16,2,3
"3405","Leela: The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered.
",16,2,3
"3406","Farnsworth: Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register!
",16,2,3
"3407","Fry: Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?
",16,2,3
"3408","Farnsworth: The very instant I became old.
",16,2,3
"3409","Farnsworth: The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
",16,2,3
"3410","Fry: The less fortunate get all the breaks!
",16,2,3
"3411","Zoidberg: You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe.
",16,2,3
"3412","Amy: Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
",16,2,3
"3413","Zoidberg: Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
",16,2,3
"3414","Fry: What party do you belong to, Bender?
",16,2,3
"3415","Bender: I'm not allowed to vote.
",16,2,3
"3416","Fry: 'Cause you're a robot?
",16,2,3
"3417","Bender: No, convicted felon.
",16,2,3
"3418","Woman: We favour unreasonably huge subsidies to the Brain Slug Planet.
",16,2,3
"3419","Fry: OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?
",16,2,3
"3420","Woman: Attach Brain Slugs to them.
",16,2,3
"3421","Fry: [sarcastic] Sure, you say that now!
",16,2,3
"3422","Amy: So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?
",16,2,3
"3423","Stoned Guy: Dave's not here, man.
",16,2,3
"3424","Amy: I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
",16,2,3
"3425","Stoned Guy: It does? No way! I gotta check out this brochure!
",16,2,3
"3426","Farnsworth: So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?
",16,2,3
"3427","N.R.A. Man: Well, first off, we're gonna get rid of that three-day waiting period for mad scientists.
",16,2,3
"3428","Farnsworth: Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?
",16,2,3
"3429","N.R.A. Man: Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without my mutated anthrax ... [He takes a vial of the stuff out of his pocket.] ... for duck hunting.

"3430","Zoidberg: Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?
",16,2,3
"3431","Hermes: I concur.
",16,2,3
"3432","Fry: Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
",16,2,3
"3433","V.A.P. Man: Sorry, not with that attitude.
",16,2,3
"3434","Fry: [downbeat] OK then, screw it.
",16,2,3
"3435","V.A.P. Man: Welcome aboard, brother!
",16,2,3
"3436","Fry: [excited] Alright!
",16,2,3
"3437","V.A.P. Man: You're out.
",16,2,3
"3438","Fry: That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
",16,2,3
"3439","Linda: [on TV] And so, with two weeks left in the campaign, the question on everyone's mind is who will be the next President of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, huh, Morbo?
",16,2,3
"3440","Morbo: [on TV] All humans are vermin in the eyes of Morbo.
",16,2,3
"3441","Linda: [on TV] In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan today, when a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 1,000 robot workers.
",16,2,3
"3442","Bender: What? Lord have mercy!
",16,2,3
"3443","Linda: [on TV] Unless something is done quickly, the trapped robots will be dead within 300 years. [She turns to a screen where a mine spokesman is stood outside the collapsed mine. Trapped robots wave their arms behind him.] Sir, what rescue operations are planned?
",16,2,3
"3444","Mine Spokesman: [on TV] The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with our lives.
",16,2,3
"3445","Morbo: [on TV] News of the mines closing sent titanium prices skyrocketing.
",16,2,3
"3446","Bender: Alright! I'm rich!
",16,2,3
"3447","Leela: What are you talking about?
",16,2,3
"3448","Bender: My body's 40% titanium! [He bangs his chest cabinet.] I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
",16,2,3
"3449","Fry: Too bad you can't spend it.
",16,2,3
"3450","Bender: [ironic] Oh, can't I?
",16,2,3
"3451","Fry: No.
",16,2,3

",16,2,3
"3453","Pawnbroker: [from inside] Pleasure doing business with you.
",16,2,3
"3454","Bender: Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves! [A dog sniffs his head.] Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing. [The dog cocks it's leg and Bender chuckles.] You just lost five dollars!
",16,2,3
"3455","Bender: Hey, buddy. Little help? [The man kicks Bender into the air.] [shouting] Thank you!
",16,2,3
"3456","Bender: Hello, peasants.
",16,2,3
"3457","Leela: Bender? What happened to you?
",16,2,3
"3458","Fry: Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?
",16,2,3
"3459","Bender: No, I sold my body.
",16,2,3
"3460","Farnsworth: Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants.
",16,2,3
"3461","Fry: This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?
",16,2,3
"3462","Bender: Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
",16,2,3
"3463","Fry: Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark.
",16,2,3
"3464","Bender: Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?
",16,2,3
"3465","Bender: Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please.
",16,2,3
"3466","Bender: Shaken, not stirred. [The man shakes his head.] Aw, yeah!
",16,2,3
"3467","Bender: Put it all on black.
",16,2,3
"3468","Croupier: 21 red. [Bender moves so his antenna points to another number.] I beg your pardon. 33 black.
",16,2,3
"3469","Bender: Yes! The rich get richer!
",16,2,3
"3470","Bender: Strike! In your face, Leela! [He laughs. Leela rolls her ball and it hits Bender.] Ow!
",16,2,3
"3471","Bender: [shouting] Timber!
",16,2,3
"3472","Fry: Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?
",16,2,3
"3473","Bender: Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!
",16,2,3
"3474","Fry: Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
",16,2,3
"3475","Bender: I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things: poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers! [He revs the engine but the car careens out of control. Bender's head falls out and the car crashes into a plant pot.] Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?
",16,2,3
"3476","Bender: Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?
",16,2,3
"3477","Schiffer: Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.
",16,2,3
"3478","Fry: I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?
",16,2,3
"3479","Schiffer: Yeah, but it was holding me back. You know, I just did the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimcap Issue.
",16,2,3
"3480","Fry: Well, you're looking great.
",16,2,3
"3481","Schiffer: Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds though.
",16,2,3
"3482","Fry: [shrugging] Couldn't hurt.
",16,2,3
"3483","Bender: Ah, US presidents. [Leela sets his head down next to George Washington.] Sturdy shelves, good security. [Two bodyguard heads look at him.] This place has class.
",16,2,3
"3484","Clinton: [to Leela] Hey, sugar cookie. You know, legally, nothing I can do counts as sex anymore.
",16,2,3
"3485","Ford: I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. He gets this way around meaty-looking women.
",16,2,3
"3486","Fry: [to Clinton] Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine.
",16,2,3
"3487","Ford: Frankly, I've never felt voting to be all that essential to the process.
",16,2,3
"3488","Nixon: No kidding, Ford.
",16,2,3
"3489","Bender: So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friend says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!""
",16,2,3
"3490","Washington: Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh me up.
",16,2,3
"3491","Bender: You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?
",16,2,3
"3492","George H.W. Bush: Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.
",16,2,3
"3493","Carter: Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the closet of presidential losers.
",16,2,3
"3494","Dole: Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't stop with the ""knock knock"" jokes.
",16,2,3
"3495","Bender: Pass.
",16,2,3
"3496","Washington: So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened to your body?
",16,2,3
"3497","Bender: I hocked it.
",16,2,3
"3498","Washington: Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?
",16,2,3
"3499","Bender: Same reason you hocked your teeth.
",16,2,3
"3500","Washington: Ah. Booze money.
",16,2,3
"3501","Nixon: I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body! God, I loved it.
",16,2,3
"3502","Fry: I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!
",16,2,3
"3503","Leela: Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.
",16,2,3
"3504","Bender: So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?
",16,2,3
"3505","Nixon: No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.
",16,2,3
"3506","Bender: Oh, great. Now you tell me!
",16,2,3
"3507","Nixon: That's my style. I like to kick 'em when they're down!
",16,2,3
"3508","Bender: [sleep-talking] Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--
",16,2,3
"3509","Fry: Bender, what is it?
",16,2,3
"3510","Bender: Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two.
",16,2,3
"3511","Fry: It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two.
",16,2,3
"3512","Bender: I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!
",16,2,3
"3513","Bender: You sold my body? To who?
",16,2,3
"3514","Pawnbroker: I can't reveal that information, but you look like a nice robot. Tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the kid.
",16,2,3
"3515","Fry: Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!
",16,2,3
"3516","Pawnbroker: Deal.
",16,2,3
"3517","Bender: [crying] Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
",16,2,3
"3518","Farnsworth: Don't you have a self-destruct button?
",16,2,3
"3519","Bender: [crying] Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?
",16,2,3
"3520","Fry: Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!
",16,2,3
"3521","Nixon: [on TV] And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing my head into the ring. I'm announcing my candidacy for the presidency of Earth.
",16,2,3
"3522","Journalist #1: Just one question.
",16,2,3
"3523","Scoop Chang: Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the constitution clearly states that nobody can be elected president more than twice.
",16,2,3
"3524","Nixon: That's right. Nobody. [He steps out from behind his podium.] But as you can plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!
",16,2,3
"3525","Bender: Oh!
",16,2,3
"3526","Leela: Bender, he's got your body!
",16,2,3
"3527","Bender: That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!
",16,2,3
"3528","Leela: Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
",16,2,3
"3529","Fry: Yeah, and that electric guitar.
",16,2,3
"3530","Nixon: [singing; on TV] Remember what the dormouse said,
Feed your head.
(talking) I'm meeting you half way, you stupid hippies! [Cheers from the crowd.] I am not a crook's head!
",16,2,3
"3531","Bender: Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!
",16,2,3
"3532","Leela: Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot.
",16,2,3
"3533","Morbo: Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates: Puny Human #1, Puny Human #2, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
",16,2,3
"3534","Nixon: Hello, Morbo. How's the family?
",16,2,3
"3535","Morbo: Belligerent and numerous.
",16,2,3
"3536","Nixon: Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
",16,2,3
"3537","Bender: Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff.
",16,2,3
"3538","Leela: Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
",16,2,3
"3539","Morbo: Morbo demands an answer to the following question: If you saw delicious candy in the hands of a small child would you seize and consume it?
",16,2,3
"3540","Johnson: Unthinkable.
",16,2,3
"3541","Jackson: I wouldn't think of it.
",16,2,3
"3542","Morbo: What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind you, you are under a truth-o-scope.
",16,2,3
"3543","Nixon: Uh, well, I, uh ... the question is-is vague. You don't say what kind of candy, whether anyone is watching or, uh... [He clears his throat.] At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm the child.
",16,2,3
"3544","Nixon's campaign manager: You scored big points tonight, sir.
",16,2,3
"3545","Nixon: What are you talking about? They ate me alive out there.
",16,2,3
"3546","Nixon's campaign manager: Yes, but your body stayed on message. And that message is, ""Look at my shiny new body"". The robots ate it up. You've got real charisma from the neck down.
",16,2,3
"3547","Nixon: Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule the universe!
",16,2,3
"3548","Bender: Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!
",16,2,3
"3549","Nixon: Now, look here, you drugged-out Communist. I paid for this body and I'd no sooner return it than I would my little cocker spaniel dog, Checkers. [The dog's head in a jar barks.] Shut up, damnit!
",16,2,3
"3550","Fry: Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency.
",16,2,3
"3551","Bender: That was a good one!
",16,2,3
"3552","Nixon: Seriously though, I'm never giving back this body. Now beat it! Before I get Cambodian on your asses!
",16,2,3
"3553","Bender: [crying] It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
",16,2,3
"3554","Fry: No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!
",16,2,3
"3555","Leela: I've got a better plan.
",16,2,3
"3556","Fry: [whispering] Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
",16,2,3
"3557","Leela: [whispering] They give you a discount if you've been here before.
",16,2,3
"3558","Fry: Keep going, we're right behind you.
",16,2,3
"3559","Bender: Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!
",16,2,3
"3560","Man: [from inside] We're in a room!
",16,2,3
"3561","Bender: Well then lose some weight.
",16,2,3
"3562","Nixon: [sleep-talking] Aroo!
",16,2,3
"3563","Nixon: [sleep-talking] Oh, yeah. You women's libbers really know how to party!
",16,2,3
"3564","Bender: [whispering] Psst! There I am!
",16,2,3
"3565","Nixon: [sleep-talking] Hey, Betty Friedan, send a little of that lotion my way!
",16,2,3
"3566","Leela: OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic.
",16,2,3
"3567","Fry: Ooh! [Below, some more writing says ""Thought Activated"".] Uh-oh!
",16,2,3
"3568","Nixon: What the-- [Fry smiles weakly at Leela.] You shaggy peaceniks have some nerve!
",16,2,3
"3569","Bender: I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
",16,2,3
"3570","Nixon: Bring it on, soup can.
",16,2,3
"3571","Leela: Alright, break it up, you two!
",16,2,3
"3572","Nixon: That's it. You're all going to jail. And don't expect me to grant a pardon like that sissy, Ford.
",16,2,3
"3573","Leela: You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
",16,2,3
"3574","Nixon: Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter and, let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat and I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place.
",16,2,3
"3575","Fry: Well, he lost my vote.
",16,2,3
"3576","Nixon: Like one vote ever made a difference. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to inch myself over to the phone and call the police.
",16,2,3
"3577","Bender: Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?
",16,2,3
"3578","Nixon: Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.
",16,2,3

"3583","Fry: Hey, I've got one last thought.

"3597","Fry: Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.

",17,2,4
"3635","Fry: Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.
",17,2,4
"3636","Hermes: A true inspiration for the children. [A buzzer goes off and the gates open. The bobsled doesn't move forward and it tips over.] Um, a little help please? [Zoidberg pushes the bobsled and it slides down the track upside-down.] [screaming] Nooo!
",17,2,4
"3637","Fry: Oh, what the hell! [He takes a run up and slides after Hermes and Zoidberg. He hits something at the bottom.] Ow!

",17,2,4
"3641","Farnsworth: Wha?
",17,2,4
"3642","Bender: Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
",17,2,4
"3643","Fry: Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit.
",17,2,4

",17,2,4
"3645","Fry: Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
",17,2,4
"3646","Leela: Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks"".
",17,2,4
"3647","Fry: Xmas, huh? [He sighs.] Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home.
",17,2,4
"3648","Leela: Hey, hey. Let me aks you something: Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?
",17,2,4

",17,2,4
"3650","Fry: Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
",17,2,4
"3651","Farnsworth: Eh, wha?
",17,2,4
"3652","Fry: They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree.
",17,2,4
"3653","Farnsworth: Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. [He takes his coat off, exposing his naked body to all.] Ah! Brisk!
",17,2,4
"3654","Fry: This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
",17,2,4

",17,2,4

",17,2,4
"3660","Fry: Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. [Amy flies around the room and crashes.] This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
",17,2,4
"3661","Hermes: Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas! [The staff gather around.] Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender.
",17,2,4
"3662","Bender: Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
",17,2,4
"3663","Hermes: And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office: Me. Hermes Conrad.
",17,2,4
"3664","Bender: Hmm. [He opens the card. The message reads ""Merry Xmas Son #1729"". With it is a photo of a robotic arm.] Ah, a picture of my mommy.
",17,2,4
"3665","Zoidberg: Huh? What's this? [His card it shaped like a lobster.] A card from my cousin Zoidfarb. [The message reads ""Santa ""Claws"" Cousin Zoidfarb"". Zoidberg chuckles.] Instead of ""Claus"" he writes ""Claws""! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card.
",17,2,4
"3666","Fry: What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth. [Enter Leela, drying her tears.] Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh? [She runs out crying more.] Yoiks! What was that about?
",17,2,4
"3667","Amy: Fluh! She's an orphan.
",17,2,4
"3668","Farnsworth: Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life.
",17,2,4
"3669","Fry: My God! Poor Leela.
",17,2,4
"3670","Bender: [upbeat] Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh. [He dances around.] Look at me, look! [He scats and Fry bursts into tears.] Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!
",17,2,4
"3671","Fry: I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
",17,2,4
"3672","Amy: I'll do it for you.
",17,2,4
"3673","Fry: Ow! Thanks.
",17,2,4
"3674","Farnsworth: You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops.
",17,2,4
"3675","Hermes: Fry's over there, man.
",17,2,4
"3676","Farnsworth: Oh?
",17,2,4
"3677","Bender: Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
",17,2,4
"3678","Linda: [on TV] The holiday season is a time of celebration for most. But it is also a time to remember the tragic suffering of the less fortunate.
",17,2,4
"3679","Morbo: [on TV] Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering.
",17,2,4
"3680","Linda: [on TV] Earlier today I visited a shelter for down-and-out robots. [The TV picture cuts to a robot shelter.] Homeless robots, too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they need to fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? Only drowning puppies. And there would have to be a lot of them.
",17,2,4
"3681","Amy: Where are you going, Bender?
",17,2,4
"3682","Bender: To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
",17,2,4
"3683","Hermes: Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable.
",17,2,4
"3684","Bender: I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
",17,2,4
"3685","Fry: Whose blood?
",17,2,4
"3686","Bender: Some guy's.
",17,2,4
"3687","Fry: I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
",17,2,4
"3688","Zoidberg: So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
",17,2,4
"3689","Fry: So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again.
",17,2,4
"3690","Hermes: Just be back by sundown, mon.
",17,2,4
"3691","Fry: We'll see. I like to haggle.
",17,2,4
"3692","Amy: You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
",17,2,4
"3693","Fry: Say what?
",17,2,4
"3694","Farnsworth: Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
",17,2,4
"3695","Fry: I know about Santa Claus.
",17,2,4
"3696","Farnsworth: Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong.
",17,2,4
"3697","Fry: Wow! 2801! Anyway...
",17,2,4
"3698","Farnsworth: Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty.
",17,2,4
"3699","Amy: If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors.
",17,2,4
"3700","Farnsworth: Nice meeting you.
",17,2,4
"3701","Preacherbot: Welcome, brother! May the blessings of the season be upon you.
",17,2,4
"3702","Bender: Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze. [The Preacherbot points.] Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
",17,2,4
"3703","Fry: There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
",17,2,4
"3704","Salesman #1: Yeah, there's a suicide booth in the food court. Though there's a line this time of year.
",17,2,4
"3705","Fry: No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown.
",17,2,4
"3706","Salesman #1: Well, you can't go wrong with something traditional. [He picks something up.] A Surface-to-Santa rocket launcher. It comes with three jolly-seeking missiles.
",17,2,4
"3707","Fry: That's funny!
",17,2,4
"3708","Salesman #1: Careful, sir!
",17,2,4
"3709","Bender: Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live. [He turns to another robot.] Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap.
",17,2,4
"3710","Tinny Tim: Excuse me, sir? Might I have a sip of booze?
",17,2,4
"3711","Preacherbot: I'm sorry, Tinny Tim. Seems we ran out early tonight.
",17,2,4
"3712","Tinny Tim: I understand.
",17,2,4
"3713","Bender: My God! That poor kid!
",17,2,4
"3714","Fry: You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela. [He looks at an eight-legged sausage dog, Bongo the rabbit from Life in Hell and a tiny giraffe in a birdcage. He doesn't like any of them.] Just give me your best animal.
",17,2,4
"3715","Salesman #2: Best? Well that's a matter of opinion. I personally like the Electric Snail.
",17,2,4
"3716","Fry: That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
",17,2,4
"3717","Salesman #2: The lizards are a buck each, the parrot is $500.
",17,2,4
"3718","Fry: That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
",17,2,4
"3719","Salesman #2: Sir, the store is closing in two minutes.
",17,2,4
"3720","Fry: Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!
",17,2,4
"3721","Fry: Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you. [The parrot squawks.] Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? [It squawks again.] Shut the hell up! [It bites his nose.] Ow! [He drops the cage and the parrot flies out.] Stupid bird! I know where you live.
",17,2,4
"3722","Amy: Hey, it's Leela.
",17,2,4
"3723","Leela: Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
",17,2,4
"3724","Farnsworth: Huh? You were gone?
",17,2,4
"3725","Leela: It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
",17,2,4
"3726","Hermes: I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog.
",17,2,4
"3727","Leela: Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
",17,2,4
"3728","Zoidberg: Why?
",17,2,4
"3729","Leela: I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
",17,2,4
"3730","Fry: Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal.
",17,2,4
"3731","Fry: Aha! Cornered!
",17,2,4
"3732","Leela: Hi, there!
",17,2,4
"3733","Fry: Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!
",17,2,4
"3734","Leela: You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry.
",17,2,4
"3735","Fry: I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family.
",17,2,4
"3736","Leela: It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together.
",17,2,4
"3737","Fry: Merry Xmas, Leela.
",17,2,4
"3738","Leela: Merry Xmas.
",17,2,4
"3739","Fry: Oh, boy! It's Santa!
",17,2,4
"3740","Santa: Ho, ho, ho! [Fry and Leela back away.] You've been very naughty, Fry and Leela. I checked my list.
",17,2,4
"3741","Fry: Well check it twice!
",17,2,4
"3742","Santa: I perform over 50 mega-checks per second. You're both naughty for disregarding each other's feelings.
",17,2,4
"3743","Leela: But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
",17,2,4
"3744","Santa: But what about your other co-workers? Did either of you ever stop to think about Dr. Zoidberg's feelings?
",17,2,4
"3745","Fry: No! I swear!

"3746","Santa: Santa has something very special in his sack for you two!

",17,2,4
"3750","Hattie: Oh, alright. But just one glass! [The robots go inside and she closes the door. We hear the robots guzzling down the cider.] [from inside] OK, that's enough. [They carry on drinking.] I said that's enough!

"3754","Leela: We're trapped.
",17,2,4
"3755","Fry: I never thought it would end this way: Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!

",17,2,4
"3772","Santa: My God, Bender! Framing an orphan? That's so naughty I'll have to add it to my list right now. [He pulls a list out and starts writing.] Framing ... I-N-G ... [The robots, Fry and Leela run away.] ... an...

"3773","Zoidberg: Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair.
",17,2,4
"3774","Amy: Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes.
",17,2,4
"3775","Hermes: Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg.
",17,2,4
"3776","Zoidberg: Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair. [He pulls his hat off. Amy's and Hermes' hair is grafted to his head.] Finally I look as pretty as I feel!

"3797","Bender: I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone.
",17,2,4
"3798","Tinny Tim: Thank you, sir.
",17,2,4
"3799","Bender: You got the toenail! [Nibbler eats the rest of the parrot and snatches Tinny Tim's piece off his plate.] Oh!
",17,2,4
"3800","Fry: Look, the food isn't what's important.
",17,2,4
"3801","Tinny Tim: I'm so hungry.
",17,2,4
"3802","Fry: The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home.
",17,2,4
"3803","Farnsworth: Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!
",17,2,4
"3804","Amy: [singing] He knows when you are sleeping.
",17,2,4
"3805","Farnsworth: [singing] He knows when you're on the can.
",17,2,4
"3806","Leela: [singing] He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
",17,2,4
"3807","Zoidberg: [singing] Oh.
",17,2,4
"3808","Hermes: [singing] You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move.
",17,2,4
"3809","Bender: [singing] You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.
",17,2,4
"3810","Fry: [singing] Santa Claus is gunning you down!
",17,2,4
"3811","Farnsworth: Merry Xmas, everyone!
",17,2,4
"3812","Santa: [over credits] I'll be back. Back when you least expect it: Next Xmas! Ho, ho, ho!
",17,2,4
"3813","Singer: [voice-over; singing; on TV] Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your towel.
",18,2,5
"3814","Plumber-bot: [singing; on TV] And we can also help with an impacted bowel.
",18,2,5
"3815","Singer: [voice-over; singing; on TV] Robo-Rooter!
",18,2,5
"3816","Fry: Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress: A Bavarian cream dog that's also self-microwaving!
",18,2,5
"3817","Bender: Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. [On the remote he presses a ""beer"" button. A hatch on the top of the TV opens up and an extending arm carrying a beer bottle extends across the room. It flicks the bottle-cap off and Bender opens his mouth. The arm tips the bottle up and the beer splashes on Bender's chest.] Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?
",18,2,5
"3818","Leela: Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
",18,2,5
"3819","Fry: Sack?
",18,2,5
"3820","Amy: And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense.
",18,2,5
"3821","Leela: Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
",18,2,5
"3822","Zoidberg: The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday.
",18,2,5
"3823","Amy: Hey, who's up for a nice, hot steam?
",18,2,5
"3824","Zoidberg: We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
",18,2,5
"3825","Nautilus: What up, Dr. Z?
",18,2,5
"3826","Zoidberg: Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!
",18,2,5
"3827","Fry: Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
",18,2,5
"3828","Leela: Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.
",18,2,5
"3829","Fry: Ah, futuristic!
",18,2,5
"3830","Amy: Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering.
",18,2,5
"3831","Leela: Those poor 20th century women.
",18,2,5
"3832","Amy: [sexfully] Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?
",18,2,5
"3833","Man: You wish!
",18,2,5
"3834","Fry: Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!
",18,2,5
"3835","Leela: Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you.
",18,2,5
"3836","Zoidberg: Give me that. [He lifts the weights off Fry, knocks him off the bench and takes his place. Enter Amy and Bender.] More weight!
",18,2,5
"3837","Fry: Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?
",18,2,5
"3838","Zoidberg: Enough with the questions. More weight! [The four add more weights.] More! [Amy and Fry leap onto the weights.] More!
",18,2,5
"3839","Leela: Maybe you could do more reps with less weight.
",18,2,5
"3840","Bender: Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell. [He chuckles.] Get it? [He chuckles again.] He's coming out--
",18,2,5
"3841","Randy: Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary stress. [Zoidberg appears in the middle of the pool. The women scream and he scuttles out of the water. A woman spontaneously gives birth and her baby cries.] Is there a doctor in the gym?
",18,2,5
"3842","Zoidberg: I'm a doctor!
",18,2,5
"3843","Leela: I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
",18,2,5
"3844","Zoidberg: I am normal. [sexfully] Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!
",18,2,5
"3845","Amy: Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me.
",18,2,5
"3846","Fry: Maybe he has a parasite.
",18,2,5
"3847","Hermes: Maybe he is a parasite!
",18,2,5
"3848","Bender: It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
",18,2,5
"3849","Farnsworth: Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative.
",18,2,5
"3850","Zoidberg: Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now.
",18,2,5
"3851","Amy: I'll do it.
",18,2,5
"3852","Leela: [simultaneous] Stop!
",18,2,5
"3853","Fry: [simultaneous] No, Amy!
",18,2,5
"3854","Bender: Moron!
",18,2,5
"3855","Farnsworth: Mm-hm... [He puts it on his shoulder.] Oh-ho! [He puts it on his chest.] Aha! There's the problem.
",18,2,5
"3856","Zoidberg: Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!
",18,2,5
"3857","Farnsworth: Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly.
",18,2,5
"3858","Leela: Bleck!
",18,2,5
"3859","Farnsworth: It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
",18,2,5
"3860","Fry: Eck!
",18,2,5
"3861","Farnsworth: There's only one thing we can do--
",18,2,5
"3862","Bender: I'll get the water boiling!
",18,2,5
"3863","Farnsworth: We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.
",18,2,5
"3864","Fry: Oh, baby, I'm there!
",18,2,5
"3865","Leela: Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?
",18,2,5
"3866","Fry: Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. [shouting] Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!
",18,2,5
"3867","Amy: Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
",18,2,5
"3868","Bender: [from inside] Moron!
",18,2,5
"3869","Decapodian Man #1: Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours until the mating frenzy!
",18,2,5
"3870","Zoidberg: Excellent, excellent!
",18,2,5
"3871","Decapodian Man #1: See you there, Doctor--
",18,2,5
"3872","Fry: Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?
",18,2,5
"3873","Zoidberg: You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
",18,2,5
"3874","Bender: You're looking less nuts, crabby.
",18,2,5
"3875","Zoidberg: I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. [sexfully] If you catch my drift.
",18,2,5
"3876","Fry: [nudging Zoidberg] Who's the lucky lobsterina?
",18,2,5
"3877","Zoidberg: I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
",18,2,5
"3878","Leela: It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
",18,2,5
"3879","Zoidberg: Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
",18,2,5
"3880","Fry: You and me both, brother!
",18,2,5
"3881","Zoidberg: Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over.
",18,2,5
"3882","Zoidberg: I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then. [A tiny crustacean crawls out of the rock pool. Zoidberg picks it up.] Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?
",18,2,5
"3883","Bender: Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!
",18,2,5
"3884","Zoidberg: No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. [angry] They don't!
",18,2,5
"3885","Fry: I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
",18,2,5
"3886","Zoidberg: Same place as your species: The beach.
",18,2,5
"3887","Zoidberg: How do I look?
",18,2,5
"3888","Bender: Like whale barf.
",18,2,5
"3889","Zoidberg: Then the illusion is complete.
",18,2,5
"3890","Fry: Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too.
",18,2,5
"3891","Decapodian Man #2: Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!
",18,2,5
"3892","Zoidberg: Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. [He jumps onto the mound and his fin pops up again. Some women walk past.] Craw!
",18,2,5
"3893","Fry: Look how ridiculous they look.
",18,2,5
"3894","Bender: Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive.
",18,2,5
"3895","Zoidberg: Craw!
",18,2,5
"3896","Decapodian Woman #1: Keep your jelly away from my eggs!
",18,2,5
"3897","Zoidberg: Craw?
",18,2,5
"3898","Decapodian Woman #2: So not interested.
",18,2,5
"3899","Zoidberg: Craw!
",18,2,5
"3900","Decapodian Woman #3: Humph. I've heard that line before!
",18,2,5
"3901","Zoidberg: Cra-- Oh, what's the point?
",18,2,5
"3902","Leela: Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
",18,2,5
"3903","Bender: 'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
",18,2,5
"3904","Fry: Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
",18,2,5
"3905","Zoidberg: Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school? [Edna makes a questioning purr.] You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!
",18,2,5
"3906","Edna: Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were back in town. I heard you went off and became a rich doctor.
",18,2,5
"3907","Zoidberg: I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?
",18,2,5
"3908","Edna: Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through a lot of things right now and-- Look, Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any other female and I owe it to our race to pick a mate who's stuffed with male jelly. Maybe a rock star.
",18,2,5
"3909","Zoidberg: Or maybe a doctor?
",18,2,5
"3910","Edna: I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an inferior male specimen. Nice seeing you again.
",18,2,5
"3911","Zoidberg: [crying] No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached.
",18,2,5
"3912","Leela: At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
",18,2,5
"3913","Zoidberg: [crying] You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!
",18,2,5
"3914","Fry: Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love. [He takes Leela's hand.] Just look her in the eye, start crying and say [fake crying] ""I've never been so happy.""
",18,2,5
"3915","Leela: If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
",18,2,5
"3916","Zoidberg: Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it.
",18,2,5
"3917","Fry: OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?
",18,2,5
"3918","Zoidberg: Ask her to mate with me.
",18,2,5
"3919","Fry: No. Tell her she's special.
",18,2,5
"3920","Zoidberg: But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
",18,2,5
"3921","Fry: Well, tell her that. And then?
",18,2,5
"3922","Zoidberg: Then mating.
",18,2,5
"3923","Fry: No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. [Zoidberg raises his hand.] Yes?
",18,2,5
"3924","Zoidberg: Is ""desire to mate"" a feeling?
",18,2,5
"3925","Fry: You're not even trying!
",18,2,5
"3926","Zoidberg: It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
",18,2,5
"3927","Fry: OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing.
",18,2,5
"3928","Zoidberg: What? Now there's a bird involved?
",18,2,5
"3929","Fry: OK, go ahead.
",18,2,5
"3930","Edna: What the-- Dr. Zoidberg, your mating display failed. Why are you trying to talk to me?
",18,2,5
"3931","Zoidberg: [shouting] I have no idea.
",18,2,5
"3932","Fry: [whispering] You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating.
",18,2,5
"3933","Zoidberg: [shouting] I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. [whispering] Fry, that doesn't make sense.
",18,2,5
"3934","Edna: Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But OK.
",18,2,5
"3935","Fry: [whispering] Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin.
",18,2,5
"3936","Zoidberg: [shouting] You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
",18,2,5
"3937","Edna: Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.
",18,2,5
"3938","Fry: [whispering] Now ask her how her day was.
",18,2,5
"3939","Zoidberg: Why would I wanna know?
",18,2,5
"3940","Fry: [whispering] You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
",18,2,5
"3941","Zoidberg: [shouting] How was your day?
",18,2,5
"3942","Edna: Well first I got up and had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the store to buy some fish. Then...
",18,2,5
"3943","Zoidberg: Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up.
",18,2,5
"3944","Fry: [whispering] That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh"".
",18,2,5
"3945","Zoidberg: [nodding] Uh-huh, uh-huh.
",18,2,5
"3946","Edna: ...And then you threw an octopus at my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's crazy but when you talk this way your obvious deficiencies as a male seem ... less obvious. Your genes seem less detrimental. [She sniffs.] You even stink more.
",18,2,5
"3947","Zoidberg: Do I ask her to mate now?
",18,2,5
"3948","Fry: [whispering] Third date!
",18,2,5
"3949","Bender: So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
",18,2,5
"3950","Zoidberg: [reading] I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
",18,2,5
"3951","Fry: [whispering] Turn it over.
",18,2,5
"3952","Zoidberg: Oh, Edna! [reading] Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest.
",18,2,5
"3953","Bender: Oy.
",18,2,5
"3954","Fry: [wiping a tear] That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
",18,2,5
"3955","Edna: Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps.
",18,2,5
"3956","Leela: Uh, me too.
",18,2,5
"3957","Zoidberg: I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?
",18,2,5
"3958","Fry: Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
",18,2,5
"3959","Leela: Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?
",18,2,5
"3960","Edna: Fry? You mean words of such beauty came from the blowhole of that hideous alien?
",18,2,5
"3961","Leela: Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey.
",18,2,5
"3962","Edna: Hmm.
",18,2,5
"3963","Edna: [from inside] Come in.
",18,2,5
"3964","Edna: [sexfully] Hello, Fry. Can I interest you in some surf and turf?
",18,2,5
"3965","Fry: No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
",18,2,5
"3966","Edna: Well that is where it comes out but jelly isn't everything. [She comes closer.] I know Zoidberg's magical words were really yours. Teach me to love you, squishy poet from beyond the stars!
",18,2,5
"3967","Fry: Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!
",18,2,5
"3968","Edna: Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your mandibles and kiss me!
",18,2,5
"3969","Zoidberg: Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I-- [He sees Fry and screams. Fry manages to break away from Edna's grip and gasps for air.] [angry] Fry!
",18,2,5
"3970","Fry: Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.
",18,2,5
"3971","Zoidberg: [angry] Her caviar is on your neck!
",18,2,5
"3972","Fry: But--
",18,2,5
"3973","Edna: Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide it any longer. Fry and I have fallen in love and we're going to mate tomorrow.
",18,2,5
"3974","Fry: What?
",18,2,5
"3975","Zoidberg: [angry] Fry! [His fin reappears and knocks his hat off.] I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
",18,2,5
"3976","Fry: English, please?
",18,2,5
"3977","Zoidberg: A fight to the death.
",18,2,5
"3978","Edna: And if you survive, we'll make sweet love!
",18,2,5
"3979","Decapodian Emperor: The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall fight to the death for the claw of the beautiful Edna.
",18,2,5
"3980","Fry: But I don't want her!
",18,2,5
"3981","Decapodian Emperor: Once invoked, the sacred tradition of Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It is a recent tradition, only 18 years old, but it is a tradition none the less.
",18,2,5
"3982","Zoidberg: Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you.
",18,2,5
"3983","Leela: Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational.
",18,2,5
"3984","Zoidberg: [shouting] Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
",18,2,5
"3985","Leela: Aww.
",18,2,5
"3986","Fry: Leela!
",18,2,5
"3987","Leela: Right, right. [She turns to the Emperor.] You have to stop this madness.
",18,2,5
"3988","Decapodian Emperor: Listen, lady, as you can plainly see I'm a highly desirable male, groaning with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of celibacy in order to uphold our crazy traditions. One of your friends must die.
",18,2,5
"3989","Bender: Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. [shouting] Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!
",18,2,5
"3990","Zoidberg: Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species: Fatal or non-fatal?
",18,2,5
"3991","Fry: Fatal.
",18,2,5
"3992","Zoidberg: Large bet on myself in round one!
",18,2,5
"3993","Decapodian Emperor: Edna, have you anything to say before begins the Claw-Plach?
",18,2,5
"3994","Edna: I do. I just want to say that today I got up and I had a piece of toast. Then I brushed my teeth--
",18,2,5
"3995","Fry: [shouting] Shut up!
",18,2,5
"3996","Edna: I love you, Fry!
",18,2,5
"3997","Decapodian Emperor: Fry, having guessed what animal I was thinking of, you shall have first choice of weapon. [Fry chooses a pair of giant nutcrackers from a case.] And you, doctor?
",18,2,5
"3998","Zoidberg: I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
",18,2,5
"3999","Fry: Shh! Nobody correct him!
",18,2,5
"4000","Bender: Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win.
",18,2,5

",18,2,5
"4002","Bender: Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!
",18,2,5

"4241","Leela: Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
",19,2,6
"4242","Fry: I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
",19,2,6
"4243","Bender: Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room.
",19,2,6
"4244","Fry: [suspicious] Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?
",19,2,6
"4245","Bender: And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
",19,2,6
"4246","Fry: Give it up!
",19,2,6
"4247","Bender: Alright, take it. Sheesh!
",19,2,6
"4248","Leela: Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.
",19,2,6
"4249","Bender: It's a darn shame.
",19,2,6
"4250","Leela: He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
",19,2,6
"4251","Fry: Or maybe, he never left at all! [He pulls the scarf off the robot.] Wait a minute. You're Bender.
",19,2,6
"4252","Bender: Of course, who said I wasn't?
",19,2,6
"4253","Fry: But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?
",19,2,6
"4254","Bender: It's a little thing called ""style"". Look it up sometime.
",19,2,6
"4255","Barker: Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet, Halatina Smogmeyer. [Halatina is made entirely of gas and blows in, waving and smiling at the audience. They cheer and cough from the fumes.] And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, The Crushinator.
",19,2,6
"4256","Crushinator: [mechanical voice] Thank you, Bob Barker. I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement.
",19,2,6
"4257","Barker: Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the atomic tiara?
",19,2,6
"4258","Leela: [whispering] Downplay the tiara.
",19,2,6
"4259","Barker: Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages.
",19,2,6
"4260","Barker: So you lost the atom, huh? You're garbage, human garbage! Do you brain-dead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?
",19,2,6
"4261","Fry: 100,000?
",19,2,6
"4262","Leela: 200,000?
",19,2,6
"4263","Bender: 200,001?
",19,2,6
"4264","Barker: [to Leela] You're closest without going over.
",19,2,6
"4265","Fry: Well, uh, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom.
",19,2,6
"4266","Barker: I'm not signing squat. You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends.
",19,2,6
"4267","Leela: But, Mr. Barker--
",19,2,6
"4268","Barker: Enough out of you. I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin.
",19,2,6
"4269","Leela: Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned.
",19,2,6
"4270","Fry: Flexo!
",19,2,6
"4271","Leela: Get him!
",19,2,6
"4272","Barker: Next up in what is generously called the ""Talent Competition"", performing a traditional gangsta rap, Miss-- What the--
",19,2,6
"4273","Bender: Gotcha!
",19,2,6
"4274","Women: [chanting] Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
",19,2,6
"4275","Bender: Shoot him, he's choking me!
",19,2,6
"4276","Flexo: No shoot him, he's choking me!
",19,2,6
"4277","Leela: I don't know which one to shoot.
",19,2,6
"4278","Fry: Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
",19,2,6
"4279","Amazonian: Women-only room!
",19,2,6
"4280","Leela: Alright, enough of this. [She shoots a display of model planets hanging from the ceiling and they fall and knock Bender and Flexo to the floor. Another planet bounces onto one of the doors, revealing the atom. Gasps all around. Bender sits up. The atom is in his chest cabinet.] There's the atom!
",19,2,6
"4281","Bender: Aw, jeez.
",19,2,6
"4282","Fry: Bender? You stole the atom?
",19,2,6
"4283","Bender: Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable.
",19,2,6
"4284","Flexo: I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.
",19,2,6
"4285","Fry: Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked.
",19,2,6
"4286","Leela: I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all--
",19,2,6
"4287","Flexo: Don't even bother. You people sicken me. I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me? Well you can go rot for all I care. [He laughs his anger away.] Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright.
",19,2,6
"4288","Fry: I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
",19,2,6
"4289","Bender: Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat.
",19,2,6
"4290","URL: Is this the guy?
",19,2,6
"4291","Barker: Huh? Oh, yeah, that looks like him. Whatever.
",19,2,6
"4292","Flexo: Wait, but I--
",19,2,6
"4293","Barker: Take him away.
",19,2,6
"4294","Barker: Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown. Brannigan, read the thing.
",19,2,6
"4295","Zapp: And the winner is...
",19,2,6
"4296","Leela: It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising--
",19,2,6
"4297","Zapp: Huh? Leela?
",19,2,6
"4298","Leela: Wait, you're making a-- [Some flowers are handed to her.] Ooh! Look at that. [A woman puts the tiara on her head.] I feel like a princess!
",19,2,6
"4299","Zapp: Wait. What are you people? Idiots? I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope. [He struggles with the envelope and finally rips it open. He takes out a piece of paper.] And the winner is: Miss Vega 4. [The women take the flowers and tiara from Leela and put it on Miss Vega 4, a big purple splodge. She waves to the audience.] [singing] There it is, Miss Universe. There it is, looking weird.
",19,2,6
"4300","Leela: I almost had that tiara.
",19,2,6
"4301","Bender: Me too.
",19,2,6
"4302","Fry: Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet.
",19,2,6
"4303","Leela: Fry, that's a radiator.
",19,2,6
"4304","Fry: Oh. [He clears his throat.] Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
",19,2,6
"4305","Lincoln: [on TV] Four score and 1145 years ago our forefathers' foreheads conceived a new nation.
",20,2,7
"4306","Washington: [on TV] And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died for.
",20,2,7
"4307","Malfunctioning Eddie: [on TV] Values like this brand new Plymouth V'Ger! Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm practically giving these cars away!
",20,2,7
"4308","Amy: Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!
",20,2,7
"4309","Bender: Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing. [He picks up a recall notice.] The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
",20,2,7
"4310","Fry: No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
",20,2,7
"4311","Leela: I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.
",20,2,7
"4312","Victor: Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women.
",20,2,7
"4313","Leela: Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
",20,2,7
"4314","Victor: Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a lady a car first. [He takes Amy over to a car.] This is the Beta Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates.
",20,2,7
"4315","Thundercougarfalconbird salesman: Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty.
",20,2,7
"4316","Fry: Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.
",20,2,7
"4317","Salesman: No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird! [He takes Fry over to a car.] Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?
",20,2,7
"4318","Fry: Sorry, I'm not here to buy.
",20,2,7
"4319","Salesman: I understand, and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation.
",20,2,7
"4320","Fry: I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
",20,2,7
"4321","Salesman: One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!
",20,2,7
"4322","Victor: The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles. Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards.
",20,2,7
"4323","Amy: That's an awful lot of eagle.
",20,2,7
"4324","Victor: Yes, and yet--
",20,2,7
"4325","Amy: What's wrong?
",20,2,7
"4326","Victor: It is just ... the luxury edition has so much more eagle. It saddens me to think of you missing out.
",20,2,7
"4327","Amy: Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich.
",20,2,7
"4328","Mechanic: I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure.
",20,2,7
"4329","Bender: You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory.
",20,2,7
"4330","Mechanic: Alright. But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow, and when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about.
",20,2,7
"4331","Amy: Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so.
",20,2,7
"4332","Victor: [quietly; to himself] No dog food for Victor tonight.
",20,2,7
"4333","Leela: OK, the sticker says 55,000, but we'll only go as high as, say--
",20,2,7
"4334","Amy: 60,000!
",20,2,7
"4335","Victor: Oh, I will have to ask my manager.
",20,2,7
"4336","Leela: Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price.
",20,2,7
"4337","Amy: I thought it was an auction.
",20,2,7
"4338","Victor: He is not too happy.
",20,2,7
"4339","Amy: I'm sorry. 80,000?
",20,2,7
"4340","Amy: Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
",20,2,7
"4341","Hermes: [from inside] And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight! [Fry and Leela look at each other and shrug.] You're bogarting my patience.
",20,2,7
"4342","Leela: Hermes, who were you yelling at?
",20,2,7
"4343","Hermes: Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off, but I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans.
",20,2,7
"4344","Fry: Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we...?
",20,2,7
"4345","Leela: You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
",20,2,7
"4346","Fry: Shall we say eight o'clock?
",20,2,7
"4347","Amy: Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?
",20,2,7
"4348","Fry: Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?
",20,2,7
"4349","Amy: The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava.
",20,2,7
"4350","Fry: So, what? Shorts?
",20,2,7
"4351","Fry: Boy, this A.C. is incredible! [He shivers.] I'd better turn on the heater too. [He does and the fuel gauge starts to go down. They pass Hg's Fuel, the only fuel station on the planet.] [shouting] Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more.
",20,2,7
"4352","Amy: [shouting] Hey, how about some icy margaritas?
",20,2,7
"4353","Fry: [shouting] Yeah! [He pushes a button and two glasses and a mixer comes out. The fuel gauge drops further.] We're slowing down!
",20,2,7
"4354","Amy: [shouting] Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
",20,2,7
"4355","Fry: [shouting] Who wants pop-tarts? [He puts the pop-tarts in the toaster and turns it on full. The engine stops, the heater and A.C. go off, the mixer stops and the car jerks to a halt, then falls to the ground. Amy gasps and sees the fuel gauge is empty. Fry takes his shades off and sees the sign to Hg's Fuel; 4750 miles one way, 4750 miles the other way.] Uh-oh!
",20,2,7
"4356","Amy: It's OK, I have an emergency phone.
",20,2,7
"4357","Fry: What are you doing?
",20,2,7
"4358","Amy: Spluh! It's a video-phone. [She presses a button on the steering wheel and a screen and dialling pad fold out. She dials.] Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association. [A man appears on the screen.] Hello? Septuple-A?
",20,2,7
"4359","Fry: Phew!
",20,2,7
"4360","Amy: It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit.
",20,2,7
"4361","Fry: Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
",20,2,7
"4362","Amy: I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. [She scoffs.] As though!
",20,2,7
"4363","Fry: I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?
",20,2,7
"4364","Amy: Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, ""Straighten your Pope hat,"" and, ""Put on your good vestments."" [Fry laughs then Amy joins in.] You know, Fry, it's nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk.
",20,2,7
"4365","Fry: Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever.
",20,2,7
"4366","Amy: So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?
",20,2,7
"4367","Fry: Yeah.
",20,2,7
"4368","Hermes: Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business?
",20,2,7
"4369","All: [simultaneous] No.

",20,2,7
"4371","All: [simultaneous] No.
",20,2,7
"4372","Hermes: Anyone spend the night together?
",20,2,7
"4373","Amy: Yep.
",20,2,7
"4374","Fry: Kind of.
",20,2,7
"4375","Bender: What?
",20,2,7
"4376","Hermes: Oh, my God!
",20,2,7
"4377","Amy: We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
",20,2,7
"4378","Fry: And it led there again when we got home.
",20,2,7
"4379","Bender: Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics.
",20,2,7
"4380","Leela: Bender! Romance isn't about money.
",20,2,7
"4381","Bender: Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!
",20,2,7
"4382","Leela: For your information, it's because he's hideous.
",20,2,7
"4383","Hermes: Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
",20,2,7

",20,2,7
"4385","Fry: What? No!
",20,2,7
"4386","Farnsworth: Really? Oh, dear.
",20,2,7
"4387","Zoidberg: You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
",20,2,7
"4388","Bender: Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
",20,2,7
"4389","Judge: $500 and time served.
",20,2,7
"4390","Bender: Stupid anti-pimping laws! [He turns to Leela.] Well, pay the man!
",20,2,7
"4391","Hookerbot: Bender, honey, we love you!
",20,2,7
"4392","Bender: Shut up, baby, I know it!
",20,2,7
"4393","Bender: Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head"".
",20,2,7
"4394","Leela: Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?
",20,2,7
"4395","Bender: Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
",20,2,7
"4396","Hermes: [shouting] Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on! I need a stapler.
",20,2,7
"4397","Zoidberg: Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
",20,2,7
"4398","Fry: [whispering] It's working, they think we're making out. [They laugh then juggle.] Wait, why aren't we making out?
",20,2,7
"4399","Amy: I 'unno.

",20,2,7
"4401","Zapp: Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan.
",20,2,7
"4402","Bender: Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
",20,2,7
"4403","Zapp: Let's see ... Oh, yes! [He punches out a hole.] Yes, definitely. [He punches out another.] Oh, I'd like some of that. [Another one.] Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu.
",20,2,7
"4404","Bender: Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier. [He screws up the sheet and throws it in his chest cabinet and imitates a computer by beeping. He then pulls out a random sheet and hands it to Zapp.] Say hello to Miss Right!
",20,2,7
"4405","Zapp: [sexfully] Hello!
",20,2,7
"4406","Fry: Wow! We're great kissers!
",20,2,7
"4407","Amy: Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.
",20,2,7
"4408","Fry: Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk.
",20,2,7
"4409","Amy: Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you.
",20,2,7
"4410","Fry: Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.
",20,2,7
"4411","Leela: You'll be back to zero soon enough.
",20,2,7
"4412","Fry: Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
",20,2,7
"4413","Amy: Hi.
",20,2,7
"4414","Fry: You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
",20,2,7
"4415","Leela: Fry--
",20,2,7
"4416","Fry: I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!
",20,2,7
"4417","Leela: I think you're over reacting.
",20,2,7
"4418","Fry: Am I? [shouting] Am I? [talking] Face it, I'm a prize catch. [He belches.] I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money.
",20,2,7
"4419","Leela: Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money.
",20,2,7
"4420","Fry: Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her.
",20,2,7
"4421","Amy: So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?
",20,2,7
"4422","Fry: Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me? [He looks over Amy's shoulder at Leela. She shakes her head.] Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.
",20,2,7
"4423","Zoidberg: Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
",20,2,7
"4424","Zoidberg: Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ... [He gobbles down the food.] ... dry woven reeds! [He eats the basket.] All gone! Can I drive?
",20,2,7
"4425","Amy: No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight.
",20,2,7
"4426","Fry: Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?
",20,2,7
"4427","Amy: OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?
",20,2,7
"4428","Fry: Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?
",20,2,7
"4429","Amy: But you just said--
",20,2,7
"4430","Fry: That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive.
",20,2,7
"4431","Zoidberg: Wahoo!
",20,2,7
"4432","Fry: [from inside] Pardon me, excuse me.
",20,2,7
"4433","Zoidberg: Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!
",20,2,7
"4434","Fry: Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?
",20,2,7
"4435","Amy: Huh? You don't like chocolate?
",20,2,7
"4436","Fry: Look, could chocolate just let me finish?
",20,2,7
"4437","Zoidberg: Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!
",20,2,7
"4438","Fry: Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--
",20,2,7

",20,2,7
"4440","Zoidberg: Fry? Are you alright?
",20,2,7
"4441","Fry: Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
",20,2,7
"4442","Zoidberg: No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash.
",20,2,7
"4443","Fry: How badly?
",20,2,7
"4444","Zoidberg: That's it over there. [He points to Fry's headless body. Fry screams.] Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery.
",20,2,7
"4445","Fry: Where is it?
",20,2,7
"4446","Zoidberg: There.
",20,2,7
"4447","Amy: Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!
",20,2,7
"4448","Leela: This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
",20,2,7
"4449","Zoidberg: Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days. [He lifts Fry's body up over his shoulder.] Upsy daisy!

",20,2,7
"4451","Amy: Fry!
",20,2,7
"4452","Fry: Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.
",20,2,7
"4453","Amy: So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?
",20,2,7
"4454","Fry: Oh, that. [He turns and sees Farnsworth sweeping behind them.] Maybe we'd better talk in private. [whispering] I'll meet you in the closet.
",20,2,7
"4455","Fry: Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together.
",20,2,7
"4456","Amy: You're breaking up with me?
",20,2,7
"4457","Fry: I just think we should start seeing other people.
",20,2,7
"4458","Amy: But, I was really having fun. [She sighs.] If that's how you feel.
",20,2,7
"4459","Fry: I'm sorry, but it is.
",20,2,7
"4460","Amy: Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?
",20,2,7
"4461","Fry: Huh?
",20,2,7
"4462","Amy: I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel.
",20,2,7
"4463","Fry: Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!
",20,2,7
"4464","Amy: With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
",20,2,7
"4465","Fry: [happy] Oh! [disappointed] Oh!
",20,2,7
"4466","Leela: So, how's business?
",20,2,7
"4467","Bender: Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day.
",20,2,7
"4468","Leela: Yeah, it's pathetic alright! [She whistles. Bender hums.] How much?
",20,2,7
"4469","Bender: 500 bucks.
",20,2,7
"4470","Leela: Done.
",20,2,7
"4471","Bender: Zapp Brannigan OK?
",20,2,7
"4472","Leela: No!
",20,2,7
"4473","Bender: 600.
",20,2,7
"4474","Fry: Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? [He turns to Amy.] In private?
",20,2,7
"4475","Amy: Oh, no problem.
",20,2,7
"4476","Fry: This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?
",20,2,7
"4477","Leela: You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!
",20,2,7
"4478","Fry: Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
",20,2,7
"4479","Leela: Bender's in his office.
",20,2,7
"4480","Fry: Thanks.
",20,2,7
"4481","Bender: I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance.
",20,2,7
"4482","Amy: OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.
",20,2,7
"4483","Fry: Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
",20,2,7
"4484","Amy: What business is it of yours?
",20,2,7
"4485","Fry: And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
",20,2,7
"4486","Amy: This is deodorant.
",20,2,7
"4487","Fry: What does it do?
",20,2,7
"4488","Amy: [shouting] C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes.
",20,2,7
"4489","Gary: [from outside] I'll be waiting.
",20,2,7
"4490","Fry: 20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
",20,2,7
"4491","Amy: Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little.
",20,2,7
"4492","Fry: Oh, God, it's true!
",20,2,7
"4493","Gary: That dress looks great on you.
",20,2,7
"4494","Amy: [simultaneous] Thanks.
",20,2,7
"4495","Fry: [simultaneous] Thanks. [He watches the door.] Where is she?
",20,2,7
"4496","Gary: I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date. Get it?
",20,2,7
"4497","Amy: Mm-mm.
",20,2,7
"4498","Fry: I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
",20,2,7
"4499","Bender: Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!
",20,2,7
"4500","Petunia: How's them eats?
",20,2,7
"4501","Fry: Uh--
",20,2,7
"4502","Petunia: Don't mind if I do. [She puts the hamburger into her handbag.] Kids'll be hungry.
",20,2,7
"4503","Fry: [whispering] She seems a little old for me.
",20,2,7
"4504","Bender: She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
",20,2,7
"4505","Petunia: Wheels fell off my house.
",20,2,7
"4506","Bender: Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
",20,2,7
"4507","Gary: I'll take one.
",20,2,7
"4508","Fry: Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.
",20,2,7
"4509","Bender: Eight bucks.
",20,2,7
"4510","Fry: But you just said--
",20,2,7
"4511","Bender: Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!
",20,2,7
"4512","Bender: Leela, meet your future husband Sal.
",20,2,7
"4513","Sal: Nice eyeball, eyeball.
",20,2,7
"4514","Leela: Nice ass, ass.
",20,2,7
"4515","Bender: Ooh, sparks! [whispering] Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!
",20,2,7
"4516","Sal: Eh, I'll take my chances.
",20,2,7
"4517","Zapp: Cheers!
",20,2,7
"4518","""Woman"": Cheers!
",20,2,7
"4519","Petunia: So tell me about your prospects. You a good gambler?
",20,2,7
"4520","Fry: Well, ma'am, I--
",20,2,7
"4521","Petunia: What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait a minute! You don't have your own body.
",20,2,7
"4522","Fry: No, but I control this arm.
",20,2,7
"4523","Petunia: Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think I can do better.
",20,2,7
"4524","Fry: Wait, come back, uh, darling.
",20,2,7
"4525","Petunia: Can't, hon', I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump.
",20,2,7
"4526","Sal: So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10:15 to Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel.
",20,2,7
"4527","Petunia: Excuse me, did you say ""10:15 to Nutley""?
",20,2,7
"4528","Sal: Why, yes I dids.
",20,2,7
"4529","Leela: [whispering] Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
",20,2,7
"4530","Bender: Of course not.
",20,2,7
"4531","Sal: [shouting] Anybodys else for Nutley?
",20,2,7
"4532","Zapp: Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise.
",20,2,7
"4533","Gary: [whispering] You know what I'd like to do...?
",20,2,7
"4534","Fry: Oh, jeez, get a room!
",20,2,7
"4535","Gary: Maybe later.
",20,2,7
"4536","Fry: Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream.
",20,2,7
"4537","Gary: Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee.
",20,2,7
"4538","Amy: I don't really like coffee.
",20,2,7
"4539","Gary: Neither do I.
",20,2,7
"4540","Amy: Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!
",20,2,7
"4541","Gary: Let me pick up the check.
",20,2,7
"4542","Fry: Nooo! [Gary drops his card onto the check.] That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here. [He tugs at his head.] Ooh! Ow!
",20,2,7
"4543","Leela: Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry.
",20,2,7
"4544","Fry: Oh, Leela!
",20,2,7
"4545","Amy: We were just on our way out.
",20,2,7
"4546","Leela: Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?
",20,2,7
"4547","Gary: I'm a banking industry regulator.
",20,2,7
"4548","Leela: Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple.
",20,2,7
"4549","Gary: Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions. Six if you wanna get technical.
",20,2,7
"4550","Leela: Oh, I do.
",20,2,7
"4551","Gary: It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened...
",20,2,7
"4552","Fry: [whispering] Thank you.
",20,2,7
"4553","Zoidberg: There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.
",20,2,7
"4554","Fry: Can I live without it?
",20,2,7
"4555","Zoidberg: If you call that living.
",20,2,7
"4556","Farnsworth: I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. [He sighs.] But I guess we're just two different people.
",20,2,7
"4557","Fry: So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff.
",20,2,7
"4558","Amy: It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you.
",20,2,7
"4559","Fry: Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back.
",20,2,7
"4560","Leela: So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
",20,2,7
"4561","Fry: Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender. [He touches his neck and kicks himself.] Ow! Cool! [He does it again.] Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night.
",20,2,7
"4562","Leela: Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
",20,2,7
"4563","Bender: Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
",20,2,7
"4564","Leela: Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
",20,2,7
"4565","Bender: Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
",20,2,7
"4566","Leela: No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
",20,2,7
"4567","Bender: True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
",20,2,7
"4568","Leela: Yeah.
",20,2,7
"4569","Fry: I guess so. [Bender laughs and puts his arms around Fry and Leela and pats them.] Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
",20,2,7
"4570","Bender: My ass! My beautiful ass!
",20,2,7
"4571","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love. [The toaster bounds across the table, barking like a dog and licks Bender. He knocks it away and it hits the wall. Toast springs out of it.] And Hermes returns from his vacation today.
",21,2,8
"4572","Hermes: [monotonous] Good morning, people.
",21,2,8
"4573","Fry: Hey, Hermes!
",21,2,8
"4574","Zoidberg: Hello!
",21,2,8
"4575","Leela: Good to see you.
",21,2,8
"4576","Farnsworth: Yo!
",21,2,8
"4577","Bender: My man!
",21,2,8
"4578","Amy: So how was the Spleef Nebula?
",21,2,8
"4579","Hermes: [monotonous] The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
",21,2,8
"4580","Fry: Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
",21,2,8
"4581","Leela: [whispering] Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
",21,2,8
"4582","Amy: [whispering] Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
",21,2,8
"4583","Hermes: [monotonous] On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug Planet.
",21,2,8
"4584","Zoidberg: What are we going to do there?
",21,2,8
"4585","Hermes: [monotonous] Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
",21,2,8
"4586","Farnsworth: Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. [He nods and then leans in to the others.] [whispering] Let's ditch him and go to the movies!
",21,2,8
"4587","Fry: Hey, yeah!
",21,2,8
"4588","Zoidberg: I'm seeing a movie with friends!
",21,2,8
"4589","Fry: Cool! Let's see this one!
",21,2,8
"4590","Leela: Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg.
",21,2,8
"4591","Amy: Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
",21,2,8
"4592","Zoidberg: Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. [He points to the films poster that parodies Planet Of The Apes except with Decapodians and bipedal clams riding bareback on horses.] It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
",21,2,8
"4593","Bender: Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits: The Movie.
",21,2,8
"4594","Fry: Yeah, I wanna see that.
",21,2,8
"4595","Bender: Good point, Bender.
",21,2,8
"4596","Fry: I'll take a small Slurm.
",21,2,8
"4597","Refreshment-bot: For only 25 cents less, you can get a super-small.
",21,2,8
"4598","Fry: Uh, OK. [The robot puts a tiny cup under the machine and it fills with a drip. Fry takes it and walks away. He trips and it spills onto his shirt.] Oh, man!
",21,2,8
"4599","Bender: Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil.
",21,2,8
"4600","Farnsworth: Down in front!

Newly-crowned Miss Universe Gladice Lennox entertains troops fighting to wipe out the human race. [The soldiers cheer.] Go get 'em, boys! [The scene changes to a wrestling ring.] And in the world of Ultimate Robot Fighting, the Masked Unit wins his championship bout against Gorgeous Gonks by technical melting.
",21,2,8
"4605","Bender: [shouting] Go, Masked Unit! [A tall robot and a wide Fembot sit in front of him. The robot blocks his view.] Uh, hey, buddy! Yo! [He whistles.] You mind taking your head off?
",21,2,8
"4606","Robot: I'm sorry, sir, but I need it to watch the movie.
",21,2,8
"4607","Bender: Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
",21,2,8

",21,2,8
"4621","Robot: Yes, that's the gist of what I said. Would you mind?

",21,2,8
"4631","Man #2: I'm impressed.

"4633","Bender: You should see me at funerals.
",21,2,8
"4634","Doubledeal: Kid, I want you in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.

",21,2,8
"4637","Farnsworth: Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
",21,2,8

",21,2,8
"4639","Amy: Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!
",21,2,8
"4640","Bender: It is?
",21,2,8
"4641","Farnsworth: There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.
",21,2,8
"4642","Bender: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
",21,2,8
"4643","Farnsworth: Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.
",21,2,8
"4644","Bender: Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
",21,2,8

",21,2,8
"4646","Fry: Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
",21,2,8
"4647","Leela: This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood.
",21,2,8
"4648","Zoidberg: Oh, again with the orphanarium!
",21,2,8
"4649","Leela: When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot.
",21,2,8
"4650","Leela: [voice-over] My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
",21,2,8
"4651","Fnog: Excellent. Bill, Keith, you will go to Junior Championships. Bill, congratulate Keith when he regains consciousness.
",21,2,8
"4652","Leela: But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed.
",21,2,8
"4653","Fnog: Perhaps. But there is more to winning than beating your opponent. You lack the will of the warrior.
",21,2,8
"4654","Leela: What do you mean? Watch this!
",21,2,8
"4655","Bill: [crying] Ow!
",21,2,8
"4656","Fnog: No girl has the will of a warrior. You have the will of a housewife or, at best, the schoolmarm.
",21,2,8
"4657","Leela: That's it. I'll take you on right now.
",21,2,8
"4658","Fnog: Very well. But, you see, I have the will of the warrior. Therefore, the battle is already over. The winner? Me! [He laughs.] Rematch? You lose again! Had enough? I thought so!
",21,2,8

",21,2,8

"4664","Referee: Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, welcome to tonight's main event. In this corner, from Mom's Friendly Robot Factory in America's heartland, Mexico: Bender!

",21,2,8
"4676","Doubledeal: What, you didn't read the pamphlet? Ultimate Robot Fighting's a scam, kid. It's rigged. [Bender gasps.] It's a secret, so keep it under your head, but the most popular robot always wins.

"4688","Chain Smoker: I love smoking. And after I win the fight I'm heading straight to your favourite restaurant.
",21,2,8
"4689","Bender: You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover.
",21,2,8
"4690","Leela: Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
",21,2,8
"4691","Bender: What do you mean, ""we""?
",21,2,8
"4692","Leela: I said ""us"".
",21,2,8

",21,2,8
"4694","Fembot #1: What about us, Mr. The Offender?
",21,2,8
"4695","Bender: Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
",21,2,8
"4696","Bender: Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?
",21,2,8
"4697","Doubledeal: Actually, we've decided to go in a different direction.
",21,2,8
"4698","Bender: What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
",21,2,8
"4699","Doubledeal: Bender, your popularity is slipping.
",21,2,8
"4700","Foreigner: Sales of your Bender Brand French milk bath soaps are down 20%.

"4701","Bender: Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!
",21,2,8
"4702","Doubledeal: Damnit, Bender! If you can't move sandalwood, you don't belong in this league! That's why you're gonna lose next week's title match.
",21,2,8
"4703","Bender: But the crowd loves me.
",21,2,8
"4704","Doubledeal: Perhaps. But let's see how they feel about your new persona: The Gender Bender.
",21,2,8
"4705","Billionairebot: You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Faeces Processor.
",21,2,8
"4706","Bender: Oh, yeah? [He throws down the tutu.] Well what if I don't let the new guy win?
",21,2,8
"4707","Doubledeal: Then he'll just have to beat you the old-fashioned way: To death! [He presses an intercom button.] Melissa, send in the new kid.
",21,2,8

",21,2,8
"4709","Bender: [squeaky] See you at the fight.
",21,2,8
"4710","Bender: So then I said, ""See you at the fight."" And that's the story.
",21,2,8
"4711","Fry: Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
",21,2,8
"4712","Bender: It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win.
",21,2,8
"4713","Leela: No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?
",21,2,8

",21,2,8
"4722","Bender: [determined] I'll put on my tutu!
",21,2,8
"4723","""Cosell"": Hello and welcome to a remarkable championship bout. Destructor, a robotic armoured tank, whose very use at battle has been ruled a war crime, versus Gender Bender, who wears a pink tutu. [Hermes, his Brain Slug, Fry and Leela are in Bender's corner.] This is Rich Little, imitating Howard Cosell, here at ringside with George Foreman. George, a word in edgewise?
",21,2,8
"4724","Foreman: This could be the most one-sided fight since 1973 when Ali faced an 80-foot tall mechanical Joe Frazier. M-My memory's not what it used to be but I think the entire Earth was destroyed.
",21,2,8
"4725","Little: Interesting, if true. The Vegas odds tonight stand at an unprecedented 1000-0; a bet of $0 on Bender pays $1000 if he wins. Still, very few takers.
",21,2,8
"4726","Foreman: It's not-not a smart bet.
",21,2,8
"4727","Leela: According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!
",21,2,8
"4728","Bender: Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!
",21,2,8
"4729","Hermes: Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
",21,2,8
"4730","Bender: Sorry, buddy. Here you go!
",21,2,8
"4731","Hermes: [monotonous] Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
",21,2,8
"4732","Amy: Here, Professor, I got you a programme.
",21,2,8
"4733","Farnsworth: Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses. [He puts on some glasses with super-thick lenses and opens the programme. His lenses rip through it.] Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here.

"4734","Referee: In this corner, the confused young robot with the golden curls. Weighing 525lbs: The Gender Bender!

",21,2,8
"4736","Nixon: [shouting] Get that hippie out of the ring!
",21,2,8
"4737","Referee: And in these two corners, weighing 400 tons, the gizmo from Pismo ... Beach, Destructor!
",21,2,8
"4738","Fnog: So, we meet again. Most amusing: Girl who acts like fighter training fighter who acts like girl.
",21,2,8
"4739","Leela: Keep laughing, Fnog! [And he does. He walks back to his corner.] Ready, Bender?
",21,2,8
"4740","Bender: I was born ready! Gimme the bell! [The bell dings.] Did you hear a noise? [Destructor punches him across the ring. Bender gets up and snaps his wand then hangs his tutu neatly on a coathanger inside his chest cabinet.] Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain. [He kicks Destructor's shin but to no effect.] Now boarding standby passengers--
",21,2,8
"4741","Foreman: This seems like as good a time as any time to bring up my new grill for no reason. [Next to him, a grill grills five steaks.] With its patented design, the fat drains directly into my mouth.

",21,2,8
"4747","Leela: So, once more we meet again.
",21,2,8
"4748","Fnog: Huh?
",21,2,8
"4749","Leela: You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!
",21,2,8
"4750","Fnog: Better than being a girl. Like you. You're a girl!
",21,2,8
"4751","Leela: [ironic] Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!

"4752","Bender: Huh? It's bendering time! [He throws some fake punches.] Take this. And this!
",21,2,8
"4753","Fnog: You were an excellent student. [Leela throws a punch but he grabs her wrist.] Too bad I was a lousy teacher!
",21,2,8
"4754","Bender: I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!
",21,2,8
"4755","Fnog: See you in girl hell. I'll be in boy hell -- much nicer!
",21,2,8
"4756","Leela: Yes!

"4757","Bender: Yes! [Destructor falls on him.] Oh!
",21,2,8
"4758","Referee: And the winner is Destructor!
",21,2,8
"4759","Little: I've not seen a spectacle of this nature in all my years impersonating a sportscaster.
",21,2,8
"4760","Foreman: It sure was some fight. Interesting side note: As a head without a body, I envy the dead.
",21,2,8
"4761","Little: No argument here.
",21,2,8
"4762","Fry: Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
",21,2,8

",21,2,8
"4764","Farnsworth: Poor little guy starved to death.
",21,2,8
"4765","Leela: I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school.
",21,2,8
"4766","Bender: I'm in tremendous pain here.
",21,2,8
"4767","Doubledeal: Great job, kid. You lost and you made it look almost half real. I want you to have this card good for 10% off at Bed Bath & Beyond.
",21,2,8
"4768","Bender: Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
",21,2,8
"4769","Little: And so ends the chronicle of one of the greatest ever to play the sport.
",21,2,8
"4770","Foreman: And he didn't look half bad in the tutu.
",21,2,8
"4771","Little: That he did surely not.
",21,2,8
"4772","Foreman: What?
",21,2,8
"4773","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through. Whee! We're online!
",22,2,9
"4774","Farnsworth: Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
",22,2,9
"4775","Leela: They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.
",22,2,9
"4776","Farnsworth: Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.

",22,2,9
"4785","Amy: Hey, that's me!
",22,2,9

",22,2,9
"4801","Leela: I'm a woman, if that's what you mean. [The nerds gasp.] I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man.
",22,2,9
"4802","Nerd #4: A woman! I'm scared.
",22,2,9
"4803","Fry: Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
",22,2,9
"4804","Bender: [sarcastic] Is the Space Pope reptilian?
",22,2,9
"4805","Hermes: Get ready for fun, Fry. Nowadays, we have a type of game played entirely on video.

",22,2,9
"4810","Leela: Who are you?
",22,2,9
"4811","Cyclops: I saw you in the chat room but you left before I had a chance to talk to you. After all these years of searching for another Cyclops.
",22,2,9

",22,2,9
"4813","Cyclops: Do you think perhaps you and I--
",22,2,9
"4814","Leela: Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!
",22,2,9
"4815","Fry: Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do-- [He jumps out and shoots Leela.] Gotcha! [She shatters. Fry jumps up and down cheering.] I won! I'm the greatest!
",22,2,9
"4816","Leela: Come on. We have work to do.
",22,2,9
"4817","Fry: Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
",22,2,9
"4818","Leela: No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?
",22,2,9
"4819","Operator: [voice-over; on screen] Leela, you've got mail! [Leela sighs.] It's not spam.
",22,2,9
"4820","Leela: Huh? [She opens the email. The Cyclops appears on the screen.] It's him!
",22,2,9
"4821","Cyclops: [on screen] To Leela. Subject: Hello. I am Alcazar. Fortunately I wrote down your screenname before I was dispatched by that oafish moron.
",22,2,9
"4822","Fry: Kicked your ass!
",22,2,9
"4823","Alcazar: [on screen] Leela, we have much to discuss. Please come join me on the planet of your birth. Co-ordinates follow.
",22,2,9
"4824","Fry: Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery.
",22,2,9
"4825","Leela: It'll get there.
",22,2,9
"4826","Leela: After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong.
",22,2,9
"4827","Bender: Too bad it's a dump.
",22,2,9
"4828","Leela: Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
",22,2,9
"4829","Fry: Lazy sculptor!
",22,2,9
"4830","Alcazar: Welcome home, Leela.
",22,2,9
"4831","Leela: Alcazar? [He leaps off the balcony and stands in front of her.] Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
",22,2,9
"4832","Alcazar: Ow! Of course I'm real.
",22,2,9
"4833","Leela: After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.
",22,2,9
"4834","Alcazar: It's alright, Leela. You'll never be alone again. [He claps his hand and two lizards run out through an arch, pulling a carriage behind them.] Come, let me introduce you to yourself. Do you mind if your servants walk?
",22,2,9
"4835","Leela: Not at all!
",22,2,9
"4836","Alcazar: We are the last remaining Cyclopses. Our planet is Cyclopia. This is the capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm going too fast for you.
",22,2,9
"4837","Leela: There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
",22,2,9
"4838","Alcazar: This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
",22,2,9
"4839","Fry: Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?
",22,2,9
"4840","Alcazar: Her perfect eye reminds me of yours, Leela. Had our race survived, you would have been a temple priestess or a supermodel.
",22,2,9
"4841","Leela: Oh, please! Really?
",22,2,9
"4842","Alcazar: And there's the infamous pirate, Purple Beard, scourge of the six seas.
",22,2,9
"4843","Fry: What's over that hill?
",22,2,9
"4844","Alcazar: The Forbidden Valley. A holy sanctuary where no one may tread.
",22,2,9
"4845","Fry: Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak. [Leela slaps him.] Ow!
",22,2,9
"4846","Leela: Fry, that's offensive to our people. [She turns to Alcazar.] Isn't it?
",22,2,9
"4847","Fry: Ow!
",22,2,9
"4848","Alcazar: This is my home. I hope you don't think less of me because I live in a giant castle.
",22,2,9
"4849","Leela: Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed.
",22,2,9
"4850","Bender: Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.
",22,2,9
"4851","Alcazar: In here is where I dream my lonely dreams and cook my simple meals.
",22,2,9
"4852","Leela: It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
",22,2,9
"4853","Alcazar: It's too painful to speak of now. Come, I'll show you your quarters.
",22,2,9
"4854","Bender: Ow! Ow! Ow!
",22,2,9
"4855","Leela: I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
",22,2,9
"4856","Alcazar: Nothing. It's just-- No, Leela. I don't want to see tears in your perfect eye.
",22,2,9
"4857","Leela: Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that.
",22,2,9
"4858","Alcazar: Well, OK. But it's chilly and you're going to be all wet from the tears. Let's go into my chamber.
",22,2,9
"4859","Alcazar: [voice-over] It wasn't long ago. Our people were happy and prosperous ... [The flashback cuts to a dark planet with rocky terrain and lots of large molehills.] ... but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 3 grew jealous of our visual prowess. They fired missile in all directions hoping to hit Cyclopia. [A mole man presses a button and several hundred missiles are launched from the planet.] Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets hit, was ours.
",22,2,9
"4860","Cyclopian Man #1: How far away do you think it is?
",22,2,9
"4861","Cyclopian Man #2: A trillion miles?
",22,2,9
"4862","Alcazar: Things got hot. You look a little hot, actually. You can take off that jacket. [Leela takes her jacket off.] Our people don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before the impact...
",22,2,9
"4863","Alcazar: [voice-over] Our smartest scientists managed to save one baby.
",22,2,9
"4864","Leela: Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!
",22,2,9
"4865","Alcazar: [voice-over] Fortunately, I was employed as a pool cleaner at the time and, when I emerged from retrieving a dead possum, I found I was the only one left.
",22,2,9
"4866","Leela: It's so tragic.
",22,2,9
"4867","Alcazar: Yes, but the real tragedy is that our race ends with us.
",22,2,9
"4868","Leela: It doesn't have to.
",22,2,9
"4869","Alcazar: What do you mean?
",22,2,9
"4870","Leela: You're a male and I'm a female.
",22,2,9
"4871","Alcazar: I'm still not following you.
",22,2,9
"4872","Leela: Wake up, my king.
",22,2,9
"4873","Alcazar: Oh, jeez, what a night. Make me some coffee, would you.
",22,2,9
"4874","Leela: Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?
",22,2,9
"4875","Alcazar: Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the basement, pans are in the attic.
",22,2,9
"4876","Leela: Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
",22,2,9
"4877","Fry: Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela.
",22,2,9
"4878","Alcazar: Yeah, they'll come in handy if I need to cover any tiny manholes. [He chuckles. Bender laughs loudly, scrapes his pancake onto the floor and slips the plate into his chest cabinet. Alcazar turns to Leela.] Listen, hon', we don't want to look like slobs in front of the other species, do we?
",22,2,9
"4879","Leela: No.
",22,2,9
"4880","Alcazar: So get to work on these dishes. And then organise my collection of naked celebrity photos by name and what you can see.
",22,2,9
"4881","Leela: Look, Alcazar--
",22,2,9
"4882","Alcazar: Call me Al.
",22,2,9
"4883","Leela: Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid.
",22,2,9
"4884","Alcazar: You're right, I'm sorry. I guess the relationship isn't going to work. So much for the Cyclops race. I thought it was a pretty good race but, uh--
",22,2,9
"4885","Leela: OK, OK, I'll do the dishes. [She looks at the table but it has been cleared.] Hey, where'd they go?
",22,2,9
"4886","Bender: Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some low-life jerk.
",22,2,9
"4887","Fry: He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
",22,2,9
"4888","Fry: Try and stop me!
",22,2,9
"4889","Leela: Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it. [She sits down next to him.] Who are these people?
",22,2,9
"4890","Alcazar: Friends.
",22,2,9
"4891","Leela: Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?
",22,2,9
"4892","Alcazar: They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you, Leela!
",22,2,9
"4893","Leela: Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear.
",22,2,9
"4894","Rat Woman: You go, girl!
",22,2,9
"4895","Alcazar: By the way, your pal Fry fell into the dungeon. Take him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place.
",22,2,9
"4896","Leela: Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?
",22,2,9
"4897","Alcazar: Jeez, Leela, twice in one day? I'm not Superman!
",22,2,9
"4898","Leela: Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
",22,2,9
"4899","Fry: 'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--
",22,2,9
"4900","Leela: I know.
",22,2,9
"4901","Fry: You do?
",22,2,9
"4902","Leela: Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave.
",22,2,9
"4903","Fry: Then dump his one-eyed ass.
",22,2,9
"4904","Leela: I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness.
",22,2,9
"4905","Alcazar: [from bathroom] Leela! Mop up in aisle number two!
",22,2,9
"4906","Leela: I'll break up with him at dinner.
",22,2,9
"4907","Fry: I'll be there.
",22,2,9
"4908","Alcazar: Yo, Leela, what gives? Pig says your slop tastes like crap.
",22,2,9
"4909","Pig: Yeah. Like crap.
",22,2,9
"4910","Fry: C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!
",22,2,9
"4911","Leela: I'm trying.
",22,2,9
"4912","Alcazar: Hey, everyone, jam a sock in your spit faucets. [Everyone stops eating and looks up.] Not long ago I spent my lonely nights renting slasher flicks with Rat Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful woman arrived and-- Stop eating, Pig! And she brought new hope for me and our once great civilisation. Now a million centuries of Cyclops destiny depend on the answer to one question. [He walks around the table to Leela and goes down on one knee.] Leela, will you marry me?
",22,2,9
"4913","Fry: [whispering] No! No!
",22,2,9
"4914","Leela: Yes! I will!
",22,2,9
"4915","Rat Woman: They're getting married!
",22,2,9
"4916","Amy: Congratulations, Leela!
",22,2,9
"4917","Zoidberg: Hello.
",22,2,9
"4918","Hermes: Oh, this is great!
",22,2,9
"4919","Leela: [shaking hands] Glad you could make it.
",22,2,9
"4920","Bender: [shaking hands] It's a magical day.
",22,2,9
"4921","Fry: [shaking hands] Welcome!
",22,2,9
"4922","Fry: Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo.
",22,2,9
"4923","Leela: Animals go in the corner.
",22,2,9
"4924","Fry: The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
",22,2,9
"4925","Leela: Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy. [She hands him a bottle.] Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be.
",22,2,9
"4926","Fry: That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
",22,2,9
"4927","Fry: Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.
",22,2,9
"4928","Bender: Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.
",22,2,9
"4929","Fry: But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
",22,2,9
"4930","Bender: I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.
",22,2,9
"4931","Fry: Bender, snap out of it!
",22,2,9
"4932","Bender: Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go. [He slings his sack of swag over his shoulder.] [singing] I love stealing, I love taking things!
",22,2,9
"4933","Zoidberg: [crying] That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
",22,2,9
"4934","Fry: Come on, boy, jump! [The lizards crash through the gate.] Good boy!
",22,2,9
"4935","Bender: Whoa, Mittens!
",22,2,9
"4936","Fry: My God! Four identical castles!
",22,2,9
"4937","Bender: Each more identical than the last!
",22,2,9
"4938","Fry: That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes.
",22,2,9
"4939","Bender: And here's another one with no eyes.
",22,2,9
"4940","Preacherbot: Does anyone have a reason why this couple shall not be joined in the irrevocable shackles of holy bliss?
",22,2,9
"4941","Farnsworth: Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
",22,2,9
"4942","Alcazar: Cut to the chase, Preach!
",22,2,9
"4943","Preacherbot: Do you, Alcazar ... [Alcazar fast-forwards the Preacherbot.] ... [fast] take this woman before you ... to love ... in sickness ... do you part?
",22,2,9
"4944","Alcazar: Yeah, sure I do. Come on, faster!
",22,2,9
"4945","Preacherbot: Do you, Leela, copy and paste his response till death do you part?
",22,2,9
"4946","Leela: I ... d--
",22,2,9
"4947","Amy: Oh, my God!
",22,2,9
"4948","Alcazar: What the--?
",22,2,9
"4949","Fry: Hey, Alcazar, you left somebody off the guest list.
",22,2,9
"4950","Five-Eyed Woman: Alcazar, why you are so late for our wedding? And why you have only one eye?
",22,2,9
"4951","Alcazar: It ... ooh, uh! [He grows four more eyes.] Hey, sweetie. Just go back to the castle and wait for me. [He turns to Leela and returns to his one eye.] She-- She's nuts. I can morph into a five-eyed alien and I kinda said I'd marry her. But I'm really a Cyclops and I'm really going to marry you.
",22,2,9
"4952","Fry: Oh, yeah? Then what about this?
",22,2,9
"4953","Alcazar: This is a bit awkward.
",22,2,9
"4954","Five-Eyed Woman: Who's she?
",22,2,9
"4955","Leela: Who's she?
",22,2,9
"4956","Sandy: Who are they?
",22,2,9
"4957","Alcazar: Go back to the castle, Sandy.
",22,2,9
"4958","Fry: And maybe you'd like to meet her. [A purple alien comes in.] And her.
",22,2,9
"4959","Alcazar: Leela, this must all be very confusing.
",22,2,9
"4960","Leela: A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
",22,2,9
"4961","Sandy: Show us your real form!
",22,2,9
"4962","Leela: Yeah!
",22,2,9
"4963","Alien #2: Do it!
",22,2,9
"4964","Alcazar: Well, this is the real me. But I can explain: We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two-way mirror. Can any of you say you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?
",22,2,9
"4965","Bender: [crying] He's a saint!
",22,2,9
"4966","Leela: But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
",22,2,9
"4967","Alcazar: Hey, lady, you got any idea what it costs to rent a tux that changes shape?
",22,2,9
"4968","Leela: Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you.
",22,2,9
"4969","Alcazar: What's that?
",22,2,9
"4970","Leela: If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?
",22,2,9
"4971","Leela: Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry.
",22,2,9
"4972","Fry: Hey, that's what I do.
",22,2,9
"4973","Leela: I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was.
",22,2,9
"4974","Farnsworth: No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home.
",22,2,9
"4975","Leela: Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?
",22,2,9
"4976","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges. Wait, that's not good news at all.
",23,2,10
"4977","Leela: Whatever you did, Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation.
",23,2,10
"4978","Farnsworth: Yes, but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far.
",23,2,10
"4979","Vernon: Professor Farnsworth, do you know why we've called you here today?
",23,2,10
"4980","Farnsworth: Listen to me, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth: It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department of Pool Boy Studies"". And Dr. Wernstrom ... Wernstrom!
",23,2,10
"4981","Vernon: Actually, Professor, we merely called you here to say... [The lights come on.] Surprise!
",23,2,10
"4982","Man #1: Surprise!
",23,2,10
"4983","Man #2: Happy birthday!
",23,2,10
"4984","Hermes: Surprise!
",23,2,10
"4985","Farnsworth: And you, Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?
",23,2,10
"4986","Leela: No, Professor! It's a surprise party for your 150th birthday.
",23,2,10
"4987","Farnsworth: [muttering] Hundred and ... what? [He smiles.] Ooh!
",23,2,10
"4988","Bender: Good evening, I'm-- [Feedback. He turns the knob on the side of his casing.] Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster.
",23,2,10
"4989","Zoidberg: Good evening, ladies and germs. [The band plays a rimshot.] That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus. [In the audience a big green germ waves.] Now, I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon. [He grins. There is no rimshot and the audience don't laugh. A man drums his fingers on the table.] Hey, Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's Showtime at the Apollo all over again.
",23,2,10
"4990","Bender: Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there! [He points at Farnsworth and chuckles.] But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?
",23,2,10
"4991","Zoidberg: I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
",23,2,10
"4992","Bender: And now, a man who needs no introduction. [He sits down and everyone looks around in confusion, Leela to her right and Zoidberg to the ceiling. Bender leans over to Fry.] [whispering] Fry, get up there!
",23,2,10
"4993","Fry: Oh. [He takes the mic and the audience applauds.] Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! [Farnsworth smiles.] Roll film!
",23,2,10
"4994","Leela: [voice-over; in movie] Hubert J. Farnsworth was born April 9th 2851 in New New York's nerdiest slum, Hell's Laboratory. A precocious child, young Hubert learned to read while he was still in diapers -- at age 8. [A photo of young Farnsworth sitting reading a book on some steps in diapers appears on the screen.] And before long he blossomed into a greasy teenager.
",23,2,10
"4995","Fry: [whispering] Dork alert!
",23,2,10
"4996","Leela: [voice-over; in movie] After 14 years of graduate school, Farnsworth settled into the glamorous life of a scientist: Fast cars, trendy nightspots, beautiful women -- the Professor designed them all working out of his tiny, one-room apartment. [The pictures appear on a blackboard in his apartment.] For 50 years he worked at Mom's Friendly Robot Company, where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan. [There is a short video clip of the robot buying its boat. The picture changes to Farnsworth tinkering with Bender's head.] And even as he nears his 150th birthday, the Professor retains the fiery passion of youth.
",23,2,10
"4997","Farnsworth: [in movie] Listen, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me.
",23,2,10
"4998","Bender: How 'bout a few words, Professor?
",23,2,10
"4999","Farnsworth: Eh, wha?
",23,2,10
"5000","Bender: I said ""words"".
",23,2,10
"5001","Farnsworth: Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time.
",23,2,10
"5002","Bender: Funny, funny stuff.
",23,2,10
"5003","Farnsworth: My life is over.
",23,2,10
"5004","Leela: No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left.
",23,2,10
"5005","Fry: Leela! He could live another 100 years!
",23,2,10
"5006","Leela: No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return.
",23,2,10
"5007","Fry: Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?
",23,2,10
"5008","Bender: [spookily] Nobody knows!
",23,2,10
"5009","Farnsworth: So many loves half-loved, so many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years.
",23,2,10
"5010","Zoidberg: If only it'd worked, you could go back and not waste your time on it.
",23,2,10
"5011","Farnsworth: There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. [He gasps.] By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor.
",23,2,10
"5012","Fry: A successor?
",23,2,10
"5013","Zoidberg: A successor to the Professor?
",23,2,10
"5014","Farnsworth: There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
",23,2,10
"5015","Fry: Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days.
",23,2,10
"5016","Bender: I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
",23,2,10
"5017","Zoidberg: You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity.
",23,2,10
"5018","Hermes: Up yours, Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only sensible way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest.
",23,2,10
"5019","Leela: What?
",23,2,10
"5020","Hermes: Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up.
",23,2,10
"5021","Leela: Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures.
",23,2,10
"5022","Amy: Yesh, he would.
",23,2,10
"5023","Fry: Sorry, everyone, but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water.
",23,2,10
"5024","Zoidberg: [writing] Blood ... thicker ... water.
",23,2,10
"5025","Farnsworth: Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye.
",23,2,10
"5026","Leela: Uh, Professor?
",23,2,10
"5027","Farnsworth: Oh, oh, yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world.
",23,2,10
"5028","Leela: Yes, we know.
",23,2,10
"5029","Hermes: True, mon.
",23,2,10
"5030","Amy: Buh!
",23,2,10
"5031","Fry: One foot in the grave.
",23,2,10
"5032","Farnsworth: So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith -- even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing. [Fry flexes his fingers and chuckles.] My closest living relative.
",23,2,10
"5033","Fry: Oh, yeah!
",23,2,10
"5034","Farnsworth: My clone, Cubert Farnsworth.
",23,2,10
"5035","Zoidberg: He's horrible!
",23,2,10
"5036","Fry: Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
",23,2,10
"5037","Amy: You wish!
",23,2,10
"5038","Fry: Where did Cubert come from?
",23,2,10
"5039","Farnsworth: 12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back.
",23,2,10
"5040","Leela: Wait. If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours?
",23,2,10
"5041","Farnsworth: I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
",23,2,10
"5042","Bender: Is he dumb or just ugly?
",23,2,10
"5043","Farnsworth: Let's find out.
",23,2,10
"5044","Cubert: What? You've never seen a genius's wiener before?
",23,2,10
"5045","Zoidberg: No.
",23,2,10
"5046","Leela: Never.
",23,2,10
"5047","Fry: Well, once in the park.
",23,2,10
"5048","Zoidberg: Mmm!
",23,2,10
"5049","Cubert: As long as I'm going to be in charge here, let me examine my so-called ""crew"", if it can so be called. First of all, Dr. Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree?
",23,2,10
"5050","Zoidberg: I lost it ... in a volcano.
",23,2,10
"5051","Cubert: And why do we need a bending robot around here anyway? What possible use do we have for you?
",23,2,10
"5052","Bender: Uh ... me no speaka the English.
",23,2,10
"5053","Cubert: And why does our space pilot have only one eye? There's someone I'd like you to meet. His name is depth perception!
",23,2,10
"5054","Leela: Why, you little--
",23,2,10
"5055","Cubert: Wow, that hurt -- the air!
",23,2,10
"5056","Bender: Im pending para un bending!
",23,2,10
"5057","Farnsworth: Oh, Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you.
",23,2,10
"5058","Cubert: What is it? A competent employee? I doubt that very much!
",23,2,10
"5059","Fry: Little twerp.
",23,2,10
"5060","Bender: Aye, Chihuahua!
",23,2,10
"5061","Farnsworth: As my successor, I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half-finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing.
",23,2,10
"5062","Cubert: I didn't realise you were the inventor of the junk heap.
",23,2,10
"5063","Farnsworth: That's my prize-winning Smellescope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop. [He points at a green machine with an oscilloscope built into it.] And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language.
",23,2,10
"5064","Cubert: Hello.
",23,2,10
"5065","Universal Translator: Bonjour!
",23,2,10
"5066","Farnsworth: Crazy gibberish!
",23,2,10
"5067","Cubert: Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?
",23,2,10
"5068","Farnsworth: Why, certainly. Step over here.
",23,2,10
"5069","Farnsworth: These are the dark matter engines I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
",23,2,10
"5070","Cubert: That's impossible. You can't go faster than the speed of light.
",23,2,10
"5071","Farnsworth: Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
",23,2,10
"5072","Cubert: Also impossible.
",23,2,10
"5073","Farnsworth: And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
",23,2,10
"5074","Cubert: That's especially impossible.
",23,2,10
"5075","Farnsworth: Not at all. It's very simple.
",23,2,10
"5076","Cubert: Then explain it.
",23,2,10
"5077","Farnsworth: Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
",23,2,10
"5078","Cubert: Your explanations are pure weapons-grade bolog-nium. It's all impossible.
",23,2,10
"5079","Farnsworth: Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.
",23,2,10
"5080","Cubert: No, that's what being a magical elf is all about.
",23,2,10
"5081","Bender: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!
",23,2,10
"5082","Elzar: How we doing here?
",23,2,10
"5083","Bender: Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!
",23,2,10
"5084","Elzar: What are you, an ass-kissing machine?
",23,2,10
"5085","Bender: Yes, sir! Good one, sir!
",23,2,10
"5086","Farnsworth: Oh, it's a gem of an evening. I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. And it's all thanks to Cubert.
",23,2,10
"5087","Cubert: Look, Professor, I may be identical to you in every possible way but that doesn't mean I'm anything like you.
",23,2,10
"5088","Farnsworth: You ... wha?
",23,2,10
"5089","Cubert: I don't wanna be an inventor. I wanna be something useful like a teacher's aide or a prison guard or a science-fiction cartoon writer.
",23,2,10
"5090","Farnsworth: But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
",23,2,10
"5091","Cubert: In your entire life your only half-decent invention was me and I didn't turn out like you wanted either.
",23,2,10
"5092","Elzar: You folks still doing alright?
",23,2,10
"5093","Bender: Oh, yes, Elzar.
",23,2,10
"5094","Elzar: Good, 'cause it turns out I forgot to cook that chicken.
",23,2,10
"5095","Farnsworth: Bad news, everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone, leaving behind me nothing but a history of failure and my original hip-bones. You see, I've been lying about my age; I'm not actually 150, I'm 160. Oh, vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth.

[He stops again by the window.] Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin ... [The Reaperbot growls.] ... and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a--

"5097","Farnsworth: [on holo-recorder] And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away.

"5098","Amy: What?
",23,2,10
"5099","Hermes: Oh, no!
",23,2,10
"5100","Zoidberg: Oh.
",23,2,10
"5101","Farnsworth: [on holo-recorder] I know you're all very upset, especially Bender.
",23,2,10
"5102","Bender: Well, life goes on. Except for you!
",23,2,10
"5103","Farnsworth: [on holo-recorder] I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark, but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message.
",23,2,10
"5104","Bender: You bastard!
",23,2,10
"5105","Fry: We've gotta get him back.
",23,2,10
"5106","Cubert: Impossible! No one knows where they take those old geezers.
",23,2,10
"5107","Fry: Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do.
",23,2,10
"5108","Cubert: You're his uncle, dummy. He takes after you.
",23,2,10
"5109","Fry: Uh ... what?
",23,2,10
"5110","Cubert: Wait a second. That means I also take after you!
",23,2,10
"5111","Leela: Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
",23,2,10
"5112","Bender: Lay it on us, big boots.
",23,2,10
"5113","Leela: If the Smellescope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him.
",23,2,10
"5114","Cubert: I think not. As you probably already don't know, odours are made up of particles that can't travel through the vacuum of space.
",23,2,10
"5115","Leela: I'm zeroing in on him. [She sniffs.] BENGAY ... mothballs ... [She sniffs again.] ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
",23,2,10
"5116","Bender: To the flying machine!
",23,2,10
"5117","Fry: To the left! [He sniffs again and moves slightly.] No, to the up! [And some more.] U-turn! U-turn!
",23,2,10
"5118","Cubert: We'll never find this place. Robots are very good at keeping secrets.
",23,2,10
"5119","Bender: No, we're not, you little bed-wetter. Oops! I'm sorry.
",23,2,10
"5120","Leela: There it is! The Near-Death Star!
",23,2,10
"5121","Leela: OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160-year-old man.
",23,2,10
"5122","Fry: I'm on it!
",23,2,10
"5123","Cubert: [sarcastic] My God, the illusion is so perfect I almost forgot I was looking at an idiot!
",23,2,10
"5124","Leela: Now, they may ask for a DNA sample.
",23,2,10
"5125","Fry: I'd like to see them find it!
",23,2,10
"5126","Cubert: This plan is impossible. We don't even have a sample of the Professor's DNA.
",23,2,10
"5127","Bender: I think I know where to get some.
",23,2,10
"5128","Cubert: Why do I have to be the hump?
",23,2,10
"5129","Fry: 'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
",23,2,10
"5130","Leela: Your Medicare dollars at work.
",23,2,10
"5131","Barrierbot #1: Halt! Identify this guest.
",23,2,10
"5132","Leela: Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped.
",23,2,10
"5133","Barrierbot #1: Escaped? No one escapes.
",23,2,10
"5134","Barrierbot #2: This guest does not look 160.
",23,2,10
"5135","Fry: What? I'm old. Listen: [old man voice] Hey, you kids, get off the lawn!
",23,2,10
"5136","Barrierbot #1: Hmm, it is true old people are often concerned that there are children on their lawns.
",23,2,10
"5137","Barrierbot #2: There's no denying that. But we'll still need to verify his identity with a DNA sample.
",23,2,10
"5138","Bender: Got a hot, steaming batch right here!
",23,2,10
"5139","Barrierbot #2: We only needed one cell!
",23,2,10
"5140","Bender: Eh, keep the change, buddy.
",23,2,10
"5141","Cubert: Stupid robot.
",23,2,10
"5142","Barrierbot #1: Did your hump just say something?
",23,2,10
"5143","Fry: Uh ... I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
",23,2,10
"5144","Barrierbot #1: Ah, T.H.S.
",23,2,10
"5145","Barrierbot #2: Identity confirmed. Return this shambling shuffle-boarder to his room.
",23,2,10
"5146","Barrierbot #1: 7152 Maple Drive.
",23,2,10
"5147","Leela: Sounds nice.
",23,2,10
"5148","Barrierbot #1: Prepare to be surprised.
",23,2,10
"5149","Fry: So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific!
",23,2,10
"5150","Leela: At least it keeps them from driving.
",23,2,10
"5151","Leela: Brace yourself for the worst.
",23,2,10
"5152","Bender: And yet he looks so natural.
",23,2,10
"5153","Cubert: What's happening?
",23,2,10
"5154","Leela: He's hooked up to a life-support system. [She pulls a tube off.] We have to disconnect him very, very carefully, or the shock could kill him.
",23,2,10
"5155","Guardbot #1: Freeze! [Leela pulls Farnsworth away from the tubes in one go and accelerates the hover-ship away from the guardbot. He chases them around the side of the gravestone and five other guardbots give chase.] Seize them!
",23,2,10
"5156","Guardbot #2: Seize them!
",23,2,10
"5157","Guardbot #3: Seize them!

",23,2,10
"5161","Guardbot #3: Uh-oh!
",23,2,10
"5162","Leela: We're probably gonna make it, but we might not.
",23,2,10
"5163","Cubert: It's impossible! We'll never fit.
",23,2,10
"5164","Fry: Will too!
",23,2,10
"5165","Cubert: Told you.
",23,2,10
"5166","Fry: Come on, Leela! Step your big boot down on the gas pedal.
",23,2,10
"5167","Leela: They've blown out one of our engines!
",23,2,10
"5168","Fry: [fast] Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!
",23,2,10
"5169","Leela: Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
",23,2,10
"5170","Fry: Try shocking him.
",23,2,10
"5171","Bender: [shouting] Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words!
",23,2,10
"5172","Fry: Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself.
",23,2,10
"5173","Leela: We can't, you bastard! No one knows how it works. It's impossible!
",23,2,10
"5174","Cubert: Nothing is impossible. I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream. [He lifts an access hatch and starts fiddling with some wires under the floor.] The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is and the engines move the universe around it.
",23,2,10
"5175","Bender: That's a complete load.
",23,2,10
"5176","Cubert: Nothing's a complete load. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about. Right, Professor? [Farnsworth mumbles. Cubert closes the access panel.] Let's ride!
",23,2,10
"5177","Cubert: Good news, everyone! He's made a complete recovery.
",23,2,10
"5178","Amy: Yeah!
",23,2,10
"5179","Hermes: Wow!
",23,2,10
"5180","Leela: All right!
",23,2,10
"5181","Farnsworth: I'm as spry as a 140-year-old. [He jumps and something cracks.] See? I only broke one ankle.
",23,2,10
"5182","Fry: So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
",23,2,10
"5183","Farnsworth: Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real.
",23,2,10
"5184","Amy: What was it like?
",23,2,10
"5185","Farnsworth: It was as though I were living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call.
",23,2,10
"5186","Leela: It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
",23,2,10
"5187","Farnsworth: Oh, my, yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you, my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.
",23,2,10
"5188","Cubert: I've already decided. Dad, when I grow up I wanna be just like you.
",23,2,10
"5189","Farnsworth: Don't worry, son, you will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder"".
",23,2,10
"5190","Cubert: Why?
",23,2,10
"5191","Farnsworth: No reason. No reason at all.
",23,2,10
"5192","Hermes: Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to Stampy Town. Population, five! [He stamps the form five times then puts it on top of a pile of other forms. He picks up the pile and staples it together.] And now for the finishing touch. [He puts the pile through a shredder and it comes out as mulch, which is recycled into blank sheets of paper. A robotic arm lifts the paper into the in-tray.] Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy. [A red tube comes down a message tube and lands in a tray.] Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy! [He takes a piece of paper out of the red tube.] [reading] Attention, Hermes Conrad: You are about to receive a letter from the Central Bureaucracy. [Another red tube appears and Hermes takes a piece of paper out of.] My God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!

"5193","Leela: I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
",24,2,11
"5194","Bender: I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
",24,2,11
"5195","Fry: I'll play.
",24,2,11
"5196","Bender: I'm in!
",24,2,11
"5197","Zoidberg: Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available.
",24,2,11
"5198","Leela: We're playing poker. But I'm warning you, my friends are serious players.
",24,2,11
"5199","Zoidberg: Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking.
",24,2,11
"5200","Fry: Wow! You look happy. Is someone fired?
",24,2,11
"5201","Hermes: Better! The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I will finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is.
",24,2,11
"5202","Leela: Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip.
",24,2,11
"5203","Hermes: Sorry, I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way: A glass of warm milk and good night sleep.
",24,2,11
"5204","Fry: Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer-space potato man.

"5205","Leela: Ah, that must be my old boss.
",24,2,11
"5206","Ipgee: Hello, Leela. You're fired.
",24,2,11
"5207","Leela: I know.
",24,2,11
"5208","Ipgee: I'm sorry but it's just that you're over a year late for work at this point.
",24,2,11
"5209","Terry: [dramatically] Let the games begin!
",24,2,11
"5210","Ipgee: So I told Leela, ""Your request for a date is most flattering but I must decline."" These office romances never work out. After all, that is how I met my horrible wife.
",24,2,11
"5211","Leela: But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
",24,2,11
"5212","Ipgee: And my wife doesn't know I have a job. I keep my personal and professional lives separate.
",24,2,11
"5213","Bender: Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor.
",24,2,11
"5214","Fry: What's with the specs, Bender?
",24,2,11
"5215","Bender: They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
",24,2,11
"5216","Fry: Hey!
",24,2,11
"5217","Zoidberg: I can't spell anything with these cards.
",24,2,11
"5218","Zoidberg: Finally, I have a good claw. See? [He turns his cards around.] Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery.
",24,2,11
"5219","Fry: It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak.
",24,2,11
"5220","Bender: Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades! [He taps his shades and they suddenly change to X-Ray specs. He looks at the cards around the table.] Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage. [He lays his cards out on the table.] Read 'em and leak salt water!
",24,2,11
"5221","Fry: Oh, man!
",24,2,11
"5222","Terry: That's my baby's milk money!
",24,2,11
"5223","Ipgee: Oh, I am broke. What will I tell my horrible wife?
",24,2,11
"5224","Bender: If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
",24,2,11
"5225","Ipgee: [suspicious] Let me see those glasses.
",24,2,11
"5226","Bender: Um ... uh...
",24,2,11
"5227","Ipgee: Oh, my various Gods! X-Ray specs!
",24,2,11
"5228","Bender: Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff.
",24,2,11
"5229","Lou: Cheater!
",24,2,11
"5230","Ipgee: Get him!
",24,2,11
"5231","Terry: Break his neck!
",24,2,11
"5232","Zoidberg: No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!
",24,2,11
"5233","Bender: [from inside] Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with X-Ray glasses would you? [Beating sounds come from inside.] Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!
",24,2,11
"5234","Hermes: Great cow of Moscow!
",24,2,11
"5235","Bender: Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!
",24,2,11
"5236","Hermes: Oh! I'll never pass inspection now. They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick ... at carnival time. [Fry and Leela poke their heads around the door.] [crying] And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
",24,2,11
"5237","Fry: Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up.
",24,2,11
"5238","Hermes: It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
",24,2,11
"5239","Hermes: Who the hell are you?
",24,2,11
"5240","Morgan: Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19.
",24,2,11
"5241","Hermes: Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36.
",24,2,11
"5242","Morgan: Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin the inspection?
",24,2,11
"5243","Hermes: This way, please.
",24,2,11
"5244","Fry: [whispering] Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this.
",24,2,11
"5245","Hermes: [whispering] Don't worry. I have a plan.
",24,2,11

",24,2,11
"5247","Amy: [shouting] No!
",24,2,11

",24,2,11
"5249","Bender: [shouting] Do a flip!
",24,2,11
"5250","Leela: [shouting] Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for.
",24,2,11
"5251","Bender: [whispering; to Leela] I get it, reverse psychology.
",24,2,11
"5252","Farnsworth: [shouting] Please, old friend, don't jump. Use another method that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know.
",24,2,11
"5253","LaBarbara: [shouting] Husband! Nooo!
",24,2,11
"5254","Hermes: Outta my way, wife! I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body.
",24,2,11
"5255","Morgan: [shouting] Bureaucrat Conrad, if you complete your death transaction without filing a suicide and/or falling accident permit, you will be posthumously demoted.
",24,2,11
"5256","Hermes: Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
",24,2,11
"5257","Hermes: Sweet something of ... of someplace.
",24,2,11
"5258","Morgan: As your superior, I hereby relieve you of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.
",24,2,11
"5259","Hermes: Oh! The ultimate penalty!
",24,2,11
"5260","Zoidberg: I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read.
",24,2,11
"5261","LaBarbara: Spa 5? Is it good?
",24,2,11
"5262","Zoidberg: Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send.
",24,2,11
"5263","Morgan: Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat to fill in for Hermes while he's away. I assign me, I accept. Welcome aboard.
",24,2,11
"5264","Zoidberg: Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!
",24,2,11
"5265","Morgan: I've been reviewing your corporate records. Regarding last Monday's delivery, why did it take twice as long as scheduled?
",24,2,11
"5266","Leela: Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
",24,2,11
"5267","Fry: [ashamed] I thought it would fit.
",24,2,11
"5268","Morgan: [to Bender] And during this period of head-crater interaction, what were you doing?
",24,2,11
"5269","Bender: Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
",24,2,11
"5270","Leela: I can explain--
",24,2,11
"5271","Morgan: You really think you can explain how you left port without a full compliment of olives? I think not.
",24,2,11
"5272","Leela: [whispering] What is this, high school?
",24,2,11
"5273","Morgan: Locker check!
",24,2,11
"5274","Morgan: Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical order?
",24,2,11
"5275","Leela: What?
",24,2,11
"5276","Morgan: The zipper. It should be at the bottom.
",24,2,11
"5277","Bender: [ashamed] Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.
",24,2,11
"5278","Morgan: I-- I've never seen anything like this. [She picks up the cap.] Why is there yoghurt in this cap?
",24,2,11
"5279","Fry: Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.
",24,2,11
"5280","Morgan: You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak to you alone.
",24,2,11
"5281","Fry: Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm ""Phry"" with a P-H.
",24,2,11
"5282","Morgan: [taking off her glasses.] Admit it, Fry: You're a slob. [She kisses him.] A dirty, filthy slob. [She kisses him again.] Dirty boy! Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!
",24,2,11
"5283","Fry: What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
",24,2,11
"5284","Morgan: I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. There's nothing kinkier to me than a filthy slop-jock like you.
",24,2,11
"5285","Fry: [bashful] Oh, stop!
",24,2,11
"5286","Morgan: Now listen, you filthy pig. No one can know about us. If anyone asks, I'll deny it.
",24,2,11
"5287","Fry: Just like very other girl I've dated.
",24,2,11
"5288","Woman: And two and three and four and ... [She point a huge laser at them.] ... come on, work those arms!
",24,2,11
"5289","LaBarbara: [whispering] This is no spa, it's a forced-labour camp.
",24,2,11
"5290","Hermes: Curse that Dr. Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business-end of a shrimp fork.
",24,2,11
"5291","Australian Man: Give him one for me too, mate. I don't know why I go to him.
",24,2,11
"5292","Woman: I don't miss twice, campers!
",24,2,11
"5293","Morgan: And for those six and a half reasons, I am demoting Leela to co-pilot.
",24,2,11
"5294","Leela: Co-pilot? Under who?
",24,2,11

",24,2,11
"5296","Leela: That drunk?
",24,2,11
"5297","Morgan: Mr. Bender, you are now in charge of co-ordinating the Professor's bodily functions.
",24,2,11
"5298","Farnsworth: That's a full-time job.
",24,2,11
"5299","Morgan: And Fry, as for you, I am promoting you to executive delivery boy. You will no longer go on deliveries and you will have your own office next to mine.
",24,2,11
"5300","Fry: Alright!
",24,2,11
"5301","Morgan: Mr. Bender, would you high-five him so we can continue this meeting? [Bender reluctantly does.] And on the rebound? [Bender kicks Fry in his left shin and Fry screams.] Meeting adjourned.
",24,2,11
"5302","Amy: I can't figure why she's so nice to you, Fry.
",24,2,11
"5303","Zoidberg: She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her.
",24,2,11
"5304","Leela: Bender, what happened to you?
",24,2,11
"5305","Bender: Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag. [Leela gestures him to shut up.] Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?
",24,2,11
"5306","Morgan: No. I'm in front of you.

"5308","Morgan: I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage and suddenly all I could think of was you. [She looks around the messy apartment.] My God! It's so ... repulsive. [She looks at something covered with a sheet and food.] So, uh, this is where you eat?
",24,2,11
"5309","Fry: Eat and sleep.
",24,2,11
"5310","Morgan: Oh, Fry!
",24,2,11
"5311","Fry: Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second.
",24,2,11
"5312","Morgan: Not likely. I ordered him to flush out the Professor's ear wax.
",24,2,11
"5313","Bender: Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with-- [He gasps.] What the--? [He zooms in. Morgan is in bed with Fry. She holds the sheets up around her. Fry pulls the sheets up around him.] Oh, now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place: The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions. [Morgan runs out with the sheets wrapped around her.] It's all coming together now!
",24,2,11
"5314","Bender: I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson.
",24,2,11
"5315","Fry: [shouting] Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop.
",24,2,11
"5316","Bender: For I was blind but now I see!
",24,2,11
"5317","Bender: [from inside] The cat's out of the bag now!
",24,2,11
"5318","Morgan: Mr. Bender, about last night: That was just a ... a misunderstanding.
",24,2,11
"5319","Bender: Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ... [He points at Fry.] ... were having sex with you.
",24,2,11
"5320","Morgan: No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank isn't supposed to fraternise.
",24,2,11
"5321","Bender: That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it,"" and they'll say ""Who, Bender? Who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable ... [His voice begins to slow down.] ... old Bender.""
",24,2,11
"5322","Fry: Hey, what did you do to him?
",24,2,11
"5323","Morgan: I downloaded his brain. Everything that is Bender is right here. His mind, his memories, his in-your-face interface.
",24,2,11
"5324","Bender: [mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",24,2,11
"5325","Fry: But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making. [Morgan puts the disk in a red tube and sends it away.] What did you do now? Stop doing things!
",24,2,11
"5326","Morgan: I sent the disk to be filed at the Central Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do, Fry; He was a bad robot.
",24,2,11
"5327","Fry: No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now.
",24,2,11
"5328","Morgan: Then you should have filed a request 20 years ago.
",24,2,11
"5329","Fry: I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!
",24,2,11
"5330","Morgan: Dirty boy! Dirty boy!
",24,2,11
"5331","Leela: You and Morgan were having an affair?
",24,2,11
"5332","Fry: I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
",24,2,11
"5333","Bender: [mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",24,2,11
"5334","Fry: Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
",24,2,11
"5335","Amy: Yeah!
",24,2,11
"5336","Farnsworth: Oh, yes, we must, yes.
",24,2,11
"5337","Amy: Why?
",24,2,11
"5338","Leela: Well, those arguments aside, we're still going.
",24,2,11
"5339","Farnsworth: You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
",24,2,11
"5340","Leela: Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
",24,2,11
"5341","Farnsworth: Oh, I've been there. Lots of times!
",24,2,11
"5342","Hermes: Look at that: The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
",24,2,11
"5343","Australian Man: [whispering] Quiet, mate. Pulling the empty carts is the closest thing we get to sleep.
",24,2,11
"5344","Hermes: But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to bring in heavy mining machinery.
",24,2,11
"5345","Man: Hey, I like the way you think.
",24,2,11
"5346","Australian Man: Oh, Lord!
",24,2,11
"5347","Man: You know, you oughta be a bureaucrat or something.
",24,2,11
"5348","Fry: Man, how long is this gonna take?
",24,2,11
"5349","Old Man: I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.
",24,2,11
"5350","Farnsworth: Well, it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh, but good luck. Just leave me where I drop.
",24,2,11
"5351","Old Man: Oh, great! Someone had a baby.
",24,2,11
"5352","Leela: Come on. I have a better idea.
",24,2,11
"5353","Leela: Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.

"5354","Bender: [mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.

"5355","Grade 53 Bureaucrat: Looks like we've got a new office cut-up!
",24,2,11
"5356","Grade 41 Bureaucrat: Look out! Look out! I'm gonna crash my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid you.
",24,2,11
"5357","Leela: While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?
",24,2,11
"5358","Grade 41 Bureaucrat: Oh, you want Central Filing.
",24,2,11
"5359","Leela: OK.
",24,2,11
"5360","Fry: OK.
",24,2,11
"5361","Amy: OK, thanks.
",24,2,11
"5362","Farnsworth: Wonderful.
",24,2,11
"5363","Grade 41 Bureaucrat: [screaming] Nooo!
",24,2,11
"5364","Grade 20 Bureaucrat: Central Filing? Of course I know where that is. I'm a grade 20.
",24,2,11
"5365","Leela: Where is it?
",24,2,11
"5366","Grade 20 Bureaucrat: I can't tell you. What do I look like? A grade 16?
",24,2,11
"5367","Leela: We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room. [She takes something of her wrist machine and puts it in the tube.] Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater.
",24,2,11
"5368","Wrist Machine: Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
",24,2,11
"5369","Grade 11 Bureaucrat: Please don't tell my supervisor I was sleeping.
",24,2,11
"5370","Leela: This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?
",24,2,11
"5371","Fry: We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?
",24,2,11
"5372","Bender: [mechanical voice] I am Bender. Please insert girder.
",24,2,11
"5373","Fry: You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope.
",24,2,11
"5374","Morgan: Lost something? [She rides a slow-mobile towards them.] I should have known you'd come here rather than follow proper procedure. And I did know. And that's why I came here.
",24,2,11
"5375","Fry: Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?
",24,2,11
"5376","Morgan: I'm afraid he's lost in the master in pile, and it would take some sort of giant, mechanical, atomic-powered sorting machine to find him.
",24,2,11
"5377","Hermes: You rang?
",24,2,11
"5378","Farnsworth: Damnit, Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver.
",24,2,11
"5379","Hermes: No, I want to live. Organising that forced-labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy.
",24,2,11
"5380","LaBarbara: My Hermes got that hellhole running so efficiently that all the physical labour is now done by a single Australian man.
",24,2,11
"5381","Leela: But how did you know we were here?
",24,2,11
"5382","Hermes: Dr. Zoidberg brought us.
",24,2,11
"5383","Zoidberg: It was me! I'm the hero!
",24,2,11
"5384","Number 1.0: Request for explanation of incident meeting?
",24,2,11
"5385","Morgan: Number 1.0.
",24,2,11
"5386","Hermes: Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point--
",24,2,11
"5387","Number 1.0: [waggling his finger] D-D-D-D-Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the colour of the book that regulation's in. We kept it grey.
",24,2,11
"5388","Hermes: Sir, please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it.
",24,2,11
"5389","Number 1.0: Very well. But your bureaucratic licence will be revoked if you fail to sort the master in pile by closing time: 1pm.
",24,2,11
"5390","Leela: That's only four minutes from now.
",24,2,11
"5391","Hermes: Requisition me a beat.[Number 1.0 plays some music and Hermes slides down a tube onto the in pile.]
[singing] When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town,
With a foot and a half of water,
Everyone was alright but I cried all night,
It blew my alphabet blocks out of order,
And they said, ""This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,
Born to be all obsessive and snotty,""
I made my friends and relations file long applications,
To get into my 10th birthday party.
",24,2,11
"5392","LaBarbara: [singing] But something changed when my man turned pro.
",24,2,11
"5393","Hermes: [singing] I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
",24,2,11
"5394","LaBarbara: [singing] He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.
",24,2,11
"5395","Hermes: [singing] It's supposed to be about the filing! People![He jumps onto Number 1.0's desk and starts juggling the tubes.]
We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,
No, that's what almighty Jah made us,
We treat people like swine,
And make 'em stand in line,
Even if nobody paid us!
",24,2,11
"5396","Hermes: [singing] They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,
They say we're anal, compulsive and weird,
But when push comes to shove,
You gotta do what you love,
Even if it's not a good idea.[He slides down the pile and throws the red tubes around the other Planet Express staff like a knife thrower.]
Zoidberg!
",24,2,11
"5397","Zoidberg: [singing] They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
",24,2,11
"5398","Farnsworth: [singing] They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter.
",24,2,11
"5399","Leela: [singing] They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.

",24,2,11
"5403","Hermes: Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!
",24,2,11

",24,2,11
"5410","Zoidberg: Congratulations.
",24,2,11
"5411","Number 1.0: Congratulations indeed but you finished with one second to spare so I'm demoting you. A good bureaucrat never finishes early.
",24,2,11
"5412","Amy: That's OK, Hermes. At least we have you back.
",24,2,11
"5413","Morgan: Not yet you don't. I'm still acting bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I have some changes to make. First, Fry, you're fired. Second--
",24,2,11
"5414","Hermes: Not so fast! While I was sorting I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B: Notification of Romantic Entanglement.
",24,2,11
"5415","Fry: That's right, she fraternised me!
",24,2,11
"5416","Morgan: That form isn't about you. It refers to my high school prom date. It was a regulation date that ended in regulation disappointment.
",24,2,11
"5417","Hermes: Yes, but you only stamped it four times!
",24,2,11
"5418","Morgan: No! No! I was young and reckless.
",24,2,11
"5419","Number 1.0: Bureaucrat Conrad, you are technically correct -- the best kind of correct. I hereby promote you to grade 37. [He changes Hermes' badge to 37. He points at Morgan.] And as for you. [shouting] Guards! [Guards surround Morgan.] [talking] Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
",24,2,11
"5420","Farnsworth: Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely-reduced pay, of course.
",24,2,11
"5421","LaBarbara: It's better than nothing.
",24,2,11
"5422","Fry: What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?
",24,2,11
"5423","Hermes: You got it, mon! In fact, severely-reduced pay all around! [The staff cheer and Hermes hops on a slow-mobile.] Come on, wife, let's blow this joint!
",24,2,11
"5424","Zoidberg: Now it's time for my song! [singing] When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--
",24,2,11
"5425","Zoidberg: [over credits] Aw.
",24,2,11
"5426","Hermes: Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived.
",25,2,12
"5427","Leela: Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
",25,2,12
"5428","Hermes: Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies! [He opens the envelope.] Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!
",25,2,12
"5429","Farnsworth: Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
",25,2,12
"5430","Bender: So we're in international waters?
",25,2,12
"5431","Farnsworth: Indeed so.
",25,2,12
"5432","Bender: Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. [A speedboat pulls up next to the ship and a man hands Bender a package which he puts in his chest cabinet. The speedboat pulls away and Bender turns to Fry and Farnsworth who haven't noticed anything.] Hey, guess what you're accessories to?
",25,2,12
"5433","Leela: The sun, the sea air, good friends.
",25,2,12
"5434","Bender: Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?
",25,2,12
"5435","Hermes: Why not?
",25,2,12
"5436","Amy: Yeah.
",25,2,12
"5437","Farnsworth: Yeah, cool.
",25,2,12
"5438","Bender: Everybody kick in five bucks. [Everyone except Zoidberg hands him $5.] There, wasn't that interesting?
",25,2,12
"5439","Leela: Bender!
",25,2,12
"5440","Fry: This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
",25,2,12
"5441","Bender: Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!
",25,2,12
"5442","Leela: I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon.
",25,2,12
"5443","Bender: Harpoon, my ass!
",25,2,12
"5444","Leela: OK.
",25,2,12
"5445","Hermes: Let's see now, which bait to use? [Zoidberg looks up.] Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?
",25,2,12
"5446","Zoidberg: Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic. [He eats a sardine.] These sardines for example are bland and tasteless. [He eats a few more.] And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy ... [He eats a few.] ... very, very juicy--
",25,2,12
"5447","Hermes: I don't believe this! It's eating my bait! [He picks up his fishing rod and hits Zoidberg with it.] Beat it, you mooching crawdad!
",25,2,12
"5448","Bender: Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod.
",25,2,12
"5449","Fry: [whispering] Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish.
",25,2,12
"5450","Bender: Fine. I'll head over to the other side. [He leans over the side of the ship.] [shouting] Good luck fishing on this side!
",25,2,12
"5451","Fry: I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
",25,2,12
"5452","Bender: Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!
",25,2,12
"5453","Fry: A shrimp? [Bender's laser guide appears between Fry's eyes.] I find it a bit hard to believe that--
",25,2,12
"5454","Leela: Aha! [She throws the harpoon and starts pulling it in.] Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!
",25,2,12
"5455","Amy: Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?
",25,2,12
"5456","Bender: Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
",25,2,12
"5457","Fry: Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. [He laughs and bends over. Bender hits him with his fishing rod again.] Ow! My small intestine!
",25,2,12
"5458","Leela: Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot.
",25,2,12
"5459","Farnsworth: You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone. [He pulls out a spray can.] The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind. [He shakes the can and tries to spray it on his line but he is holding it the wrong way so it sprays back in his face.] Uh-oh!
",25,2,12
"5460","Zoidberg: [sexfully] I'm so into you!
",25,2,12
"5461","Farnsworth: Oh, my!
",25,2,12
"5462","Fry: [shouting] Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!
",25,2,12
"5463","Bender: Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! [He throws his fishing rod in the bin.] If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish. [He takes Amy's parasol and bends it to make a giant fish hook.] There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending.
",25,2,12
"5464","Farnsworth: Bender, be careful. That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.
",25,2,12
"5465","Bender: Then why do I have to be careful?
",25,2,12
"5466","Farnsworth: It belonged to my grandmother.
",25,2,12
"5467","Hermes: My Manwich!
",25,2,12
"5468","Leela: Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive! [She pulls out another boot with Zoidberg on the end of it and groans.] Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?
",25,2,12
"5469","Zoidberg: I wasn't wearing it. [ashamed] I was eating it.
",25,2,12
"5470","Leela: Come on, let's go home.
",25,2,12
"5471","Amy: Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
",25,2,12
"5472","Bender: I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella. [Amy growls.] What? I put sunblock on you.
",25,2,12
"5473","Amy: Well it didn't work!
",25,2,12
"5474","Leela: Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go.
",25,2,12
"5475","Bender: Hey, I'm snagged.
",25,2,12
"5476","Farnsworth: It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something! [Bender struggles to pull in the line. A huge shadow looms towards the ship from the water.] Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!
",25,2,12
"5477","Amy: It's coming up!
",25,2,12
"5478","Hermes: Oh, that's big!
",25,2,12
"5479","Farnsworth: A colossal-mouth bass!
",25,2,12
"5480","Fry: It's diving!
",25,2,12
"5481","Leela: It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
",25,2,12
"5482","Zoidberg: Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament! [He snips at the tether with his claw but it doesn't break.] Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?
",25,2,12
"5483","Hermes: [from ship] My Speedos!
",25,2,12
"5484","Leela: Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!
",25,2,12
"5485","Farnsworth: Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure.
",25,2,12
"5486","Fry: How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
",25,2,12
"5487","Farnsworth: Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one.
",25,2,12
"5488","Bender: What's that? Is someone bending girders?
",25,2,12
"5489","Leela: We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
",25,2,12
"5490","Fry: How do we do that?
",25,2,12
"5491","Farnsworth: That should do it.
",25,2,12
"5492","Amy: We're all gonna die!
",25,2,12
"5493","Fry: Wait, I'll be back in a minute.
",25,2,12
"5494","Leela: You did it, Fry!
",25,2,12
"5495","Fry: Did what?
",25,2,12
"5496","Bender: People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away.
",25,2,12
"5497","Leela: There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater.
",25,2,12
"5498","Bender: [restrained] Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
",25,2,12
"5499","Hermes: The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this. [He holds up the Code of Conduct for Cannibalism book.] Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg-- I mean lobster Newburg-- I mean Doctor Zoidberg.
",25,2,12
"5500","Leela: OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food.
",25,2,12
"5501","Fry: I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
",25,2,12
"5502","Hermes: Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugar cane truck.
",25,2,12
"5503","Farnsworth: Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
",25,2,12
"5504","Fry: I can't swallow that.
",25,2,12
"5505","Farnsworth: Well then good news! It's a suppository.
",25,2,12
"5506","Zoidberg: How are you doing there, Fry? [Fry blubbers.] Glad to hear it. [He picks up another fish.] Aha!
",25,2,12
"5507","Bender: Aw, yeah!
",25,2,12
"5508","Zoidberg: Yum, yum, yum! [He eats it, not realising it is the top of a large pilot fish.] Uh-oh! [The fish chases him and Zoidberg woops and hides in a shell. The fish passes him and he scuttles back to Fry and Bender with the shell on his back.] Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!
",25,2,12
"5509","Zoidberg: Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous.
",25,2,12
"5510","Bender: Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog. [He opens the bottle and tries to drink what is in it but the liquid just drips out and trails away from him in the ocean current.] Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!
",25,2,12
"5511","Zoidberg: Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?
",25,2,12
"5512","Bender: Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.
",25,2,12
"5513","Zoidberg: What is it, Fry?
",25,2,12
"5514","Fry: [blubbering] I think I saw a mermaid.
",25,2,12
"5515","Bender: You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
",25,2,12
"5516","Zoidberg: Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!
",25,2,12
"5517","Leela: Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.
",25,2,12
"5518","Fry: A mermaid!
",25,2,12
"5519","Amy: You think you saw a mermaid?
",25,2,12
"5520","Fry: No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions.
",25,2,12
"5521","Bender: Yeah, right!
",25,2,12
"5522","Leela: Sure she did.
",25,2,12
"5523","Hermes: OK, Fry!
",25,2,12
"5524","Farnsworth: You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron.
",25,2,12
"5525","Fry: What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg.
",25,2,12
"5526","Leela: I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
",25,2,12
"5527","Fry: Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.
",25,2,12
"5528","Leela: [whispering] Ocean madness.
",25,2,12
"5529","Farnsworth: He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
",25,2,12
"5530","Fry: [muttering] Ocean madness. Yeah, right. It's always something, ain't it? [The mermaid knocks on the window and Fry gasps.] [talking] It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up! [Bender turns up the volume on himself and snores louder. The mermaid beckons Fry. He heads for the door then remembers something.] Oh! oxygen!
",25,2,12
"5531","Mermaid: Here you go, darlin'.
",25,2,12
"5532","Fry: Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!
",25,2,12
"5533","Mermaid: Oh, you speak fish?
",25,2,12
"5534","Fry: What?
",25,2,12
"5535","Mermaid: I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, my name's Umbriel!
",25,2,12
"5536","Fry: I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?
",25,2,12
"5537","Umbriel: Course not. Just stay calm and let the currents relax your every muscle.
",25,2,12
"5538","Fry: Aw, yeah!
",25,2,12
"5539","Umbriel: Did it just get warmer?
",25,2,12
"5540","Fry: I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
",25,2,12
"5541","Umbriel: Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly doo-dads comin' outta your hips.
",25,2,12
"5542","Fry: Oh, thanks. They're called pants.
",25,2,12
"5543","Umbriel: This here's a volcanic vent. The water comes out at over 4000 degrees.
",25,2,12
"5544","Fry: No kidding.
",25,2,12
"5545","Umbriel: Did it just get colder? [Fry jabs some shrimps with a stick and toasts them over the vent.] Tell me more about that bizarre land-y world you come from. Is there water there too?
",25,2,12
"5546","Fry: Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky.
",25,2,12
"5547","Umbriel: Hm.
",25,2,12
"5548","Fry: And sometimes it doesn't.
",25,2,12
"5549","Umbriel: Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!
",25,2,12
"5550","Fry: You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.
",25,2,12
"5551","Umbriel: Lions? There are sealions on the land?
",25,2,12
"5552","Fry: Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
",25,2,12
"5553","Farnsworth: I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.
",25,2,12
"5554","Leela: Where's Fry?
",25,2,12
"5555","Bender: I didn't kill him. Professor?
",25,2,12
"5556","Farnsworth: No, I've been busy.
",25,2,12
"5557","Hermes: He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor, demented honky.
",25,2,12
"5558","Leela: It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!
",25,2,12
"5559","Farnsworth: We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen.
",25,2,12
"5560","Bender: I got it covered. [He opens his chest cabinet and the crew take out some oxygen masks and put them on.] In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device.
",25,2,12
"5561","Farnsworth: Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken your pressure pills, right?
",25,2,12
"5562","Amy: Yes! Stop asking!
",25,2,12
"5563","Zoidberg: I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
",25,2,12
"5564","Bender: [awestruck] Bend me!
",25,2,12
"5565","Amy: Dude! An ancient sunken city!
",25,2,12
"5566","Farnsworth: Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true? [Leela rubs away the flora from the sign, revealing ""City Of Atlanta"". The staff gasp.] It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!
",25,2,12
"5567","Merman: Howdy, y'all!
",25,2,12
"5568","Colonel: Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these parts call me the Colonel. [Bender hums Dueling Banjos.] Here, have some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber of Commerce.
",25,2,12
"5569","Farnsworth: This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository.
",25,2,12
"5570","Colonel: Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our main source of income round here so see the sights, spend some money. Please don't leave!
",25,2,12
"5571","Bender: Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! [whispering] I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!
",25,2,12
"5572","Fry: Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.
",25,2,12
"5573","Colonel: Nice out of town folks, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, these are some Yankees.
",25,2,12
"5574","Amy: So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?
",25,2,12
"5575","Fry: I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
",25,2,12
"5576","Umbriel: No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, the equal of Paris or New York.
",25,2,12
"5577","Fry: That's right, honey! Whatever you say.
",25,2,12
"5578","Umbriel: Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, the, uh, the airport.
",25,2,12
"5579","Leela: But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?
",25,2,12
"5580","Colonel: Ah, now that's a story that can only rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce video narrated by folk-rock troubadour Donovan.
",25,2,12
"5581","Donovan: [on screen] Atlanta was a city, landlocked,
Hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean,
Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism,
That they moved offshore, becoming an island,
And an even bigger Delta hub,
",25,2,12
"5582","Donovan: [on screen] until the city overdeveloped
And it started to sink.
Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,
Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy,
The Guy Who Invented Coca-Cola, the Magician,
And the other so-called gods of our legends,
Though gods they were--
And also, Jane Fonda was there.
",25,2,12
"5583","Donovan: The others chose to remain behind
On their porches with their rifles,
And one day evolve into mermaids,
And sing and dance,
And ring in the new.
",25,2,12
"5584","Mermaids: [on screen] Hail Atlanta!
",25,2,12
"5585","Leela: The magician?
",25,2,12
"5586","Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?
",25,2,12
"5587","Umbriel: Normally, yes, but the caffeine really sped things up. [She points at a leak in the Coca-Cola factory.] That stuff's wonderful.
",25,2,12
"5588","Colonel: So when Umbriel first brought home this carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, damnit, if Old Legs here ain't grown on me!
",25,2,12
"5589","Fry: Aw, shucks, Colonel.
",25,2,12
"5590","Hermes: Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen.
",25,2,12
"5591","Farnsworth: Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry.
",25,2,12
"5592","Fry: Wait. I'm not going with you.
",25,2,12
"5593","Leela: But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here.
",25,2,12
"5594","Zoidberg: She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.
",25,2,12
"5595","Farnsworth: Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?
",25,2,12
"5596","Fry: Realise it? I don't even understand it!
",25,2,12
"5597","Farnsworth: It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
",25,2,12
"5598","Fry: I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
",25,2,12
"5599","Farnsworth: [shouting] I'm bored! Let's go!
",25,2,12
"5600","Zoidberg: You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?
",25,2,12
"5601","Fry: Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club.
",25,2,12
"5602","Bender: [crying] Oh, Fry! [He bawls.] I'll miss you!
",25,2,12
"5603","Colonel: Y'all come back now, y'hear?
",25,2,12
"5604","Farnsworth: [shouting] Let's go, damnit! Let's go!
",25,2,12
"5605","Zoidberg: Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well.
",25,2,12
"5606","Leela: Whatever.
",25,2,12
"5607","Amy: Later.
",25,2,12
"5608","Farnsworth: Bye.
",25,2,12
"5609","Zoidberg: No! My home! It burned down! [Hermes and Bender walk out of the ship. Zoidberg cries.] [crying] How did this happen?
",25,2,12
"5610","Hermes: That's a very good question.
",25,2,12
"5611","Bender: So that's where I left my cigar.
",25,2,12
"5612","Hermes: That just raises further questions!
",25,2,12
"5613","Fry: You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life.
",25,2,12
"5614","Umbriel: Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman outta mer-me.
",25,2,12
"5615","Fry: Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
",25,2,12
"5616","Umbriel: What the hell is that?
",25,2,12
"5617","Fry: Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
",25,2,12
"5618","Umbriel: I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I lay my eggs and leave and you release your fertiliser.
",25,2,12
"5619","Fry: [gasping] Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?
",25,2,12
"5620","Umbriel: Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante Ball?
",25,2,12
"5621","Colonel: Well what about that rich, young dugong from Macon?
",25,2,12
"5622","Farnsworth: There! The engine modifications are complete.
",25,2,12
"5623","Leela: Prepare for launch.
",25,2,12
"5624","Fry: Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
",25,2,12
"5625","Poopenmeyer: And so, in honour of his record-breaking catch, I'm proud to award Bender this cheque for $1000.

",25,2,12
"5630","Amy: What about Umbriel?
",25,2,12
"5631","Fry: Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.
",25,2,12
"5632","Amy: [whispering] Trouble in bed.
",25,2,12
"5633","Bender: Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.
",25,2,12
"5634","Poopenmeyer: Wait a-- This is no record! Gimme back that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant orphans.
",25,2,12
"5635","Fry: Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!
",25,2,12
"5636","Zoidberg: Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
",25,2,12
"5637","Donovan: [over credits] Hail Atlanta!
",25,2,12
"5638","Bender: Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one.
",26,2,13
"5639","Announcer: [on loudspeaker] And now, here he is: Chef, restaurateur, author of Cooking Slugs For Dinner and Cooking Dinner For Slugs ... Elzar!
",26,2,13
"5640","Bender: Yeah! [Above them Elzar flies in on a jet pack and lands at the back of the studio.] Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!
",26,2,13
"5641","Man: Elzar! [Elzar passes a centipede-like alien wearing a ""Knock It Up A Notch"" T-shirt.] Alright!
",26,2,13
"5642","Bender: Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you. [He holds up a crude picture of himself staring lovey-eyed at Elzar. Elzar takes it stamps ""I'll Sign This For $50.00. x___"" on it and hands it back to Bender.] [crying] Oh, Elzar! Bless you!
",26,2,13
"5643","Elzar: Now this is why I prefer your non-stick robots.
",26,2,13
"5644","Bender: [disappointed] Oh. [The audience claps and cheers.] [normal] Alright, yeah! [The ""Applause"" sign changes to ""Less Applause"".] [quietly] Alright, yeah!
",26,2,13
"5645","Elzar: Hey, I hope you folks like Cajun food. [Bender hoots.] 'Cause today we're making Elzar's down-home Neptune-style gumbo. Now, step one. You wanna boil some oysters in a pot of down-home Neptune-style gumbo.
",26,2,13
"5646","Bender: [loudly] Boiled? Interesting.
",26,2,13
"5647","Leela: [whispering] Bender, please try to be a little quieter.
",26,2,13
"5648","Bender: No, you shut up.
",26,2,13
"5649","Elzar: Of course, every now and then you'll wanna knock it up a notch with a blast from your spice weasel. [He takes one out and squeezes it.] Bam!
",26,2,13
"5650","Bender: Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!
",26,2,13
"5651","Elzar: Jeez, who let this guy through the metal detector?
",26,2,13
"5652","Bender: Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us.
",26,2,13
"5653","Elzar: If you promise to stop interrupting, alright. Against my will, I'm gonna knock it up another notch.
",26,2,13
"5654","Bender: I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film. [He stands up.] Hey, Elzar, think fast.
",26,2,13
"5655","Elzar: What, huh?
",26,2,13
"5656","Leela: Ow! My eye! I'm blind!

",26,2,13
"5659","Taco Bellevue Doctor: Grande.
",26,2,13
"5660","Zoidberg: I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
",26,2,13
"5661","Doctor #2: OK. What does this look like to you?
",26,2,13
"5662","Leela: Um ... a grey-ish blob?
",26,2,13
"5663","Doctor #2: Right. [He swaps the blob with a picture of a toucan playing tennis.] And this one?
",26,2,13
"5664","Leela: Um ... a grey-ish blob?
",26,2,13
"5665","Doctor #2: Not as right that time. It looks like you might have some mild corneal irritation.
",26,2,13
"5666","Zoidberg: Nice try, little boy. You may have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace!
",26,2,13
"5667","Doctor #2: You seem a bit tense. [He tips some pills onto his hand.] Here, try these.
",26,2,13
"5668","Zoidberg: Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work, sonny! [He slurps the pills off the doctor's hand and his pupils dilate.] [high] Why always the fighting?
",26,2,13
"5669","Doctor #2: Your eye just needs some rest. You'll have to wear this patch for about a week.

",26,2,13

",26,2,13

",26,2,13
"5690","Fry: No, really, I don't-- [Bender stuffs a spoonful in his mouth and he screams as his tongue catches fire. The flame goes out and Fry tastes it and smiles.] Mmm!
",26,2,13
"5691","Amy: Are you doing alright over there, Leela?
",26,2,13
"5692","Leela: Oh, yeah, this salad's fantastic. [She takes a forkful of flowers from the middle of the table.] So fresh.

",26,2,13
"5716","Zoidberg: Please don't hit me. I'm brittle!

",26,2,13
"5719","Bender: I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?
",26,2,13
"5720","Elzar: No question.
",26,2,13
"5721","Bender: So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?
",26,2,13
"5722","Elzar: I don't know. I usually hire people who are a little less unbearable.
",26,2,13
"5723","Hermes: Oh, Bender's a model employee.
",26,2,13
"5724","Amy: He's so polite.
",26,2,13
"5725","Leela: And hard-working.
",26,2,13
"5726","Fry: He's made of candy.
",26,2,13
"5727","Elzar: OK, fine, I'll give it a shot.
",26,2,13

",26,2,13
"5729","Hermes: [cheering] Yes!
",26,2,13
"5730","Bender: Hot diggety!
",26,2,13
"5731","Smitty: You'd better keep your nose clean.
",26,2,13
"5732","Bender: That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
",26,2,13
"5733","Hermes: Ah! Time for my precious 10am meeting. [He looks around the table.] Where in Legoland is Leela?
",26,2,13
"5734","Leela: I'm here and I'm getting along just fine, thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason.
",26,2,13
"5735","Amy: Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup.
",26,2,13
"5736","Leela: I don't need help. For your information I did this all by myself.
",26,2,13
"5737","Farnsworth: You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso.
",26,2,13
"5738","Bender: Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone.
",26,2,13
"5739","Farnsworth: Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you. [He gets up and heads for the door.] Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal...
",26,2,13
"5740","Bender: Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call.
",26,2,13
"5741","Bender: I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint. [He takes a mint from a bowl and leaves grease over the rest of them.] So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?
",26,2,13
"5742","Elzar: Bam!
",26,2,13
"5743","Bender: [muttering] Bam yourself! [The door opens and three robots walk in. One of them is short, has a scar on his face and clamps instead of hands, another wears a hat, cloak and carries a cane and the third, the tallest, wears a chain around his neck with a computer mouse attached to it. The lead robot hands his hat to the one with the clamps and his cloak to the one with the mouse. A waitress shows them through.] [talking] Hey, who are they?
",26,2,13
"5744","Elzar: Let's just say they're very good customers and I'm not answering anymore questions.
",26,2,13
"5745","Bender: Are they the Robot Mafia?
",26,2,13
"5746","Elzar: Yes.
",26,2,13
"5747","Donbot: You call this a table? You call this a table? I wouldn't hit a guy over the head with this table.
",26,2,13
"5748","Clamps: You hear that? The Donbot don't like it. I oughta clamp you. You wanna be clamped?
",26,2,13
"5749","Joey: Whoa! Whoa! Calm down, Clamps. [He turns to the waitress.] The boss, he likes a wall up which his back can be put against. Such as like this there.
",26,2,13
"5750","Waitress: But that table's already--
",26,2,13
"5751","Bender: Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen. [He walks over to the table and pulls the tablecloth away, leaving the plates and glasses undisturbed. The family applauds.] No, what I meant to do was--
",26,2,13
"5752","Woman: Oh!
",26,2,13
"5753","Man: I can't believe this!
",26,2,13
"5754","Bender: Mind your own business and get out!
",26,2,13
"5755","Donbot: Huh. I like this guy's lack of style.
",26,2,13
"5756","Clamps: So I finally get this guy a pair of cement shoes which he likes 'cause they're lighter than his lead ones.
",26,2,13
"5757","Donbot: Hey! You think this computes over here? Where's all my change? I gave you a hundred.
",26,2,13
"5758","Bender: No, you gave me a fifty.
",26,2,13
"5759","Donbot: Oh, no I didn't.
",26,2,13
"5760","Bender: Yeah, you did.
",26,2,13
"5761","Clamps: Hey, you tryin' to steal from the Donbot?
",26,2,13
"5762","Bender: I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
",26,2,13
"5763","Donbot: Get a load of the ball bearings on this guy, huh. I like you, kid. Here's something for your trouble. [He slips something into Bender's apron pocket.] [whispering] It's money.
",26,2,13
"5764","Bender: Wow! Thanks.
",26,2,13
"5765","Donbot: Hey, you earned that 50 bucks.
",26,2,13
"5766","Bender: You gave me a twenty.
",26,2,13
"5767","Donbot: I did? [He starts counting out some extra cash.] Oh, I'm sorry, I meant to-- Hey, wait a minute. [He laughs.] I got a good feeling about you. Say, you wanna work for me as a hired goon?
",26,2,13
"5768","Bender: Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning! [He takes off his apron, screws it up and throws it on the floor.] [shouting] Hey, Elzar! I quit!
",26,2,13
"5769","Elzar: [shouting; from foyer] K.
",26,2,13
"5770","Donbot: We're gonna try you out with a little delivery job. It's for a, uh, private lottery that we run.
",26,2,13
"5771","Bender: Wow, you guys run numbers?
",26,2,13
"5772","Clamps: Well, nothing fancy, y'know. Ones and zeros mostly.
",26,2,13
"5773","Donbot: Just take this disk over to the pool hall and give it to Sammy ""The Mechanical Bull"" Gravano. And watch out for the cops.
",26,2,13
"5774","Bender: That's just what my mom used to tell me.
",26,2,13
"5775","Bender: That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in.
",26,2,13
"5776","Tinny Tim: You flatter me, kind goon. But I'm only programmed to sell oil-ade and write in cute backwards letters like on the sign here.
",26,2,13
"5777","Bender: Aw, crap! The cops!
",26,2,13
"5778","Smitty: Seen any suspicious activity?
",26,2,13
"5779","URL: Nope. But check out today's Marmaduke. Solid!

",26,2,13
"5782","Smitty: Gotcha!
",26,2,13
"5783","Bender: What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?
",26,2,13
"5784","Smitty: We'll decide what you were doing after an illegal search.
",26,2,13
"5785","URL: He's clean. [He closes the door.] Smells nice too.

",26,2,13
"5788","Tinny Tim: Courtesy of Mr. Bender.
",26,2,13

",26,2,13
"5790","Bender: Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies.
",26,2,13
"5791","Donbot: Oh. Then we should meet at our Mafia crime headquarters.
",26,2,13
"5792","Robot: Donbot, I beg you, I can't make this week's loan payment. Look into your hard drive and open your mercy file.
",26,2,13
"5793","Donbot: File not found. [Clamps and Joey take out some laser-Tommy guns and shoot the robot, riddling him with laser holes. He screams and falls to the floor.] Let that be a warning to you.
",26,2,13
"5794","Robot: Thank you, Donbot.
",26,2,13
"5795","Bender: Joey! Clamps! Donny B!
",26,2,13
"5796","Donbot: Hey, listen, Bender. We got a big score planned but, uh, we need some muscle.
",26,2,13
"5797","Bender: A little of this, huh?
",26,2,13
"5798","Joey: Ho! Ho! This guy's an ox! He's got oxen-like strength! Hey, he needs a nickname, right? Let's call him Clamps.
",26,2,13
"5799","Clamps: Clamps? That's my name, you numbskull! Don't make me clamp you one!
",26,2,13
"5800","Bender: How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers.
",26,2,13
"5801","Joey: Good thinking. Hey, hey! Now, this score ain't gonna be no cake walk in the tea park, alright? There may be some death killing.
",26,2,13
"5802","Clamps: It's gonna be clamp this, clamp that. Bada-climp, bada-clamp!
",26,2,13
"5803","Donbot: What d'you think, Blotto? You in?
",26,2,13
"5804","Bender: It's funny: Until now I always wanted to be a gangster ... so the answer's yes.
",26,2,13
"5805","Clamps: Yeah!
",26,2,13
"5806","Joey: Hey, hey! Way to go, way to be, way to shoot!
",26,2,13
"5807","Donbot: Now, since we're committing crimes that may be against the law, I suggest you have an alibi.
",26,2,13
"5808","Bender: An alibi, huh?
",26,2,13
"5809","Bender: [groaning; from quarters] I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
",26,2,13
"5810","Fry: But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes.
",26,2,13
"5811","Bender: [groaning; from quarters] I can't move.
",26,2,13
"5812","Bender: [groaning; on tape] Oh, I think I'm gonna output.
",26,2,13
"5813","Fry: [from outside] OK, you stay in bed. I'll eat yours.
",26,2,13
"5814","Fry: Bender's sick. [Leela presses the button and the ship rises into its 45-degree launch position. Fry eats a sundae and talks with his mouth full.] Need any help taking off?
",26,2,13
"5815","Leela: I'm fine, thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone.
",26,2,13
"5816","Hermes: That's coming outta your pay!
",26,2,13
"5817","Bender: You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?
",26,2,13
"5818","Donbot: We're heisting a shipment of Zuban cigars.
",26,2,13
"5819","Bender: Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
",26,2,13
"5820","Joey: Yo! There's our pigeon now. Let's shoot bullets out of our guns.
",26,2,13
"5821","Donbot: Alright, here's the battle plan: We shoot, they surrender, we go aboard, somebody does some clamping, then we heist the cigars and go home.
",26,2,13
"5822","Bender: And all without killing anyone. [He whistles.] This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that.
",26,2,13
"5823","Joey: Oh, we'll kill 'em alright.
",26,2,13
"5824","Clamps: We got 'em heavily out-clamped. They won't know what clamped 'em!
",26,2,13
"5825","Fry: Wow! It's too bad you can't see, Leela, 'cause there's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody.
",26,2,13
"5826","Leela: I'm taking evasive action.
",26,2,13
"5827","Fry: Uh, Leela?
",26,2,13
"5828","Leela: Stop bothering me, Fry, I need full concentration.
",26,2,13
"5829","Computer Voice: Missile evaded.
",26,2,13
"5830","Leela: Eyesight is for chumps.
",26,2,13
"5831","Donbot: Their desire to keep living shows me no respect. Hey, Blotto, roll down the window and start shooting.
",26,2,13
"5832","Bender: Um, uh, um. [He opens the window, leans out and pretends to fire the gun, making the noises. He looks back in at Donbot who doesn't turn around. He makes an explosion sound.] [fake hurt] Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!
",26,2,13
"5833","Leela: Wait! Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turn Master Steering Wheel Company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh, no!
",26,2,13
"5834","Leela: [on screen] I'm back at the wheel, Fry. Everything's under control.
",26,2,13
"5835","Fry: Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance!
",26,2,13
"5836","Joey: They're coming straight toward our proximity. Maybe you should give 'em the clamps, Clamps.
",26,2,13
"5837","Clamps: Gee, you think? You think that maybe I should use these clamps that I use every day at every opportunity? [shouting] You're a freaking genius, you idiot!
",26,2,13
"5838","Leela: The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
",26,2,13
"5839","Donbot: Hello, we're the Robot Mafia. The entire Robot Mafia. We're here to steal your cigars.
",26,2,13
"5840","Leela: You'll never get away with this.
",26,2,13
"5841","Fry: Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
",26,2,13
"5842","Donbot: Joey, Clamps, hurry and blindfold them before they see us some more.
",26,2,13
"5843","Joey: Hey, boss, looks like somebody beat us to it.
",26,2,13
"5844","Leela: I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Hi-yah!
",26,2,13
"5845","Donbot: Hey, where's Blotto? He should be here learning the trade.
",26,2,13
"5846","Bender: Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich.
",26,2,13
"5847","Donbot: Hey. He's more classy than I realised. Tie up the prisoners.
",26,2,13
"5848","Bender: Capital idea, old sport. [He ties Fry to chair. Nibbler tugs his leg and points at the mobbots.] I say, get the hell off me!
",26,2,13
"5849","Leela: [whispering] That guy sounds familiar.
",26,2,13
"5850","Bender: My word, what have we-- [He gasps. Leela stares at him. She can just about make out Bender's shape but he puts the eye patch back on her.] Uh, nothing to see here, old girl.
",26,2,13
"5851","Joey: Hey, boss, this here crew list lists a robot on this crew here.
",26,2,13
"5852","Donbot: Alright. I want you to find him and plug him. Then unplug him.
",26,2,13
"5853","Fry: No!
",26,2,13
"5854","Clamps: I got a little surprise in store for that guy: The clamps! Eh?
",26,2,13
"5855","Bender: Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer.
",26,2,13
"5856","Fry: [whispering] Oh, no! Poor Bender.
",26,2,13
"5857","Bender: [groaning; on tape; from quarters] Oh, I don't feel good.
",26,2,13
"5858","Bender: [from quarters] Chew on this! [normal voice] Ooh, ah! [fake voice] What ho! [normal voice] Stop it!
",26,2,13
"5859","Bender: [fake voice] Take that, you twit. [normal voice] No! Stop it!
",26,2,13
"5860","Donbot: That's the last of 'em. [Joey and Clamps walk back in through the linkway.] Alright, now let's Mafia things up a little. [He takes two oil containers out of his chest cabinet.] Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
",26,2,13
"5861","Bender: Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik.
",26,2,13
"5862","Donbot: Hey, I like your attitude. And your latest accent. Keep it up and I might just get you your own pair of clamps, huh?
",26,2,13
"5863","Clamps: [muttering] He's gonna get clamps? Clamps, clamps ... [He and Joey leave.] ... clamps, clamps!
",26,2,13
"5864","Bender: Phew!
",26,2,13
"5865","Fry: Leela, we may not have much time left ... [Bender sneaks past them to an empty chair.] ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic.
",26,2,13
"5866","Bender: Uh, help! Help!
",26,2,13
"5867","Leela: Bender!
",26,2,13
"5868","Fry: You're OK!
",26,2,13
"5869","Bender: Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness.
",26,2,13
"5870","Leela: I've got an idea. Hold still. [She rubs her ropes against Bender's arm.] It's about to break. Yes! Yes!
",26,2,13
"5871","Leela: [cheering] Alright!
",26,2,13
"5872","Bender: Yeah that broke, alright!
",26,2,13
"5873","Fry: I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt.
",26,2,13
"5874","Leela: Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my eye patch off.
",26,2,13
"5875","Zoidberg: I'll handle the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment.
",26,2,13
"5876","Leela: I think it's Blotto, that gangster I saw when my patch fell off. [Bender rubs some sweat off his head with Nibbler. Leela focuses. The shape turns into Farnsworth.] Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?
",26,2,13
"5877","Farnsworth: Where am I now?
",26,2,13
"5878","Bender: So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
",26,2,13
"5879","Tinny Tim: Fine kick, sir. But I'm actually here to deliver your cut from the cigar heist.
",26,2,13
"5880","Bender: Oh, sweet legal tender! [He takes the cash and starts to eat it.] Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind.
",26,2,13
"5881","Fry: It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
",26,2,13
"5882","Bender: And maybe someday I won't listen.
",26,2,13
"5883","Linda: [on TV] And in sports, Yankees' fifth blernsman, William Wu, is out with an injured knee.
",27,2,14
"5884","Morbo: [on TV] So, humans have easily injured knees. My race will find this information very useful indeed.
",27,2,14
"5885","Linda: [on TV] And finally, today is Mother's Day; a sentimental occasion when robots honour Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly Robot Company. [The picture on the screen changes to robots buying gifts.] Across Earth, robots built in Mom's factories are buying thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon who brought them into the world.

",27,2,14
"5890","Bender: I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em. [Everyone gasps and Fry drops the box.] I love her that much.
",27,2,14
"5891","Hermes: What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?
",27,2,14
"5892","Bender: Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea. [He holds up the figure of two smartly-dressed mice at a tea table. The caption on the base reads ""A Spot of Tea, Mr. Squeaks?"" He rummages in the trolley some more.] And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old. [In the photo, he is already smoking and drinking.] But the best part is I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card. [The card has a picture of a sun setting over the sea on the front.] [reading]
You created me, Mom,
So I guess you're to blame,
For the love that I feel,
Just from hearing your name...[The others cringe.]
You're as tender as corned beef,
And warm as pastrami...

",27,2,14

",27,2,14

",27,2,14

",27,2,14

"6134","Leela: No.

",28,2,15
"6136","Fry: Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.

"6137","Bender: What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns.
",28,2,15
"6138","Leela: Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
",28,2,15
"6139","Fry: Well? How are they? [Leela swallows, her eye widens, and she falls to the ground and starts cramming her mouth with the things. Fry eats one and gasps.] Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!

"6140","Bender: You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
",28,2,15

",28,2,15
"6142","Bender: The planet's covered with 'em.
",28,2,15
"6143","Fry: Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
",28,2,15
"6144","Bender: No, a whole Bender-ful!

",28,2,15
"6155","Bender: Why not?
",28,2,15
"6156","Leela: It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?
",28,2,15
"6157","Hermes: According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are ""Popplers"" and ""Zittzers"".

",28,2,15

",28,2,15

",28,2,15
"6163","Zoidberg: Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
",28,2,15

",28,2,15
"6181","Fry: A dollar a dozen.
",28,2,15

",28,2,15
"6196","Waterfall Jr.: [shouting] We're with Mankind for Ethical Animal Treatment. [He holds up a M.E.A.T. pamphlet with a picture of a man pushing a pig on a swing on the cover.] Popplers are living creatures. You gotta stop harvesting them for food!

",28,2,15
"6202","Waterfall Jr.: No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat tofu. [He points at a skinny lion on a leash. It coughs.] The point is you shouldn't eat things that feel pain.

"6204","Leela: I'll go get some more bricks.

",28,2,15
"6211","Zoidberg: Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
",28,2,15

",28,2,15
"6218","Leela: I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama"".
",28,2,15
"6219","Fry: Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?
",28,2,15
"6220","Bender: Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry.
",28,2,15
"6221","Fry: [nodding] Like Fry! Like Fry!
",28,2,15
"6222","Farnsworth: There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent. [He stands up and rubs his hands together.] Dissect its brain!

",29,2,16
"6398","Fry: Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?
",29,2,16

"6435","Leela: Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about.

"6436","Hermes: Come on, woman! Just pick something.
",29,2,16
"6437","Fry: Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this.

",29,2,16
"6439","Leela: I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while. [Fry hums and chops a banana onto his head.] Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little. [Farnsworth pushes a button with the fing-longer.] Not too much.
",29,2,16
"6440","Leela: Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse: New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!
",29,2,16

",29,2,16
"6442","Farnsworth: I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone. [He drops the meat into a pit in the middle of the room. In the pit three giant anteaters eat it.] The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela.
",29,2,16
"6443","Leela: Hello? New boots!
",29,2,16
"6444","Farnsworth: That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive.
",29,2,16
"6445","Leela: Yah!
",29,2,16
"6446","Farnsworth: [shouting] Ooh! [The anteaters start to eat him.] Oh, you've killed me! You've killed me!
",29,2,16
"6447","Leela: Oh, God! What have I done?
",29,2,16
"6448","Farnsworth: I just told you, you've killed me!
",29,2,16
"6449","Leela: OK, just try to be nonchalant.
",29,2,16
"6450","Zoidberg: Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it.
",29,2,16
"6451","Hermes: Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
",29,2,16
"6452","Zoidberg: What?
",29,2,16
"6453","Hermes: If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things.
",29,2,16
"6454","Zoidberg: Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy. [He puts on a deerstalker and pulls out a magnifying glass.] Zoidberg is afoot!
",29,2,16
"6455","Hermes: Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up. [reading] ""Citation for public nudity"", ""Conspiracy to commit public nudity"". [talking] Aha! A new will! Naming ... [He gasps.] ... you as his sole heir.
",29,2,16
"6456","Leela: That doesn't prove I killed him.
",29,2,16
"6457","Hermes: It's a video will. It shows you killing him.

"6458","Leela: [from meeting room] Hi-yah!
",29,2,16
"6459","Zoidberg: Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting? [Hermes dives into the room but is dragged out again.] Is it anteater number two? [Leela runs in, grabs an axe and runs out again.] Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name! [An anteater makes a noise.] What? How do you spell that?
",29,2,16
"6460","Hermes: [shouting; from meeting room] What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!

",29,2,16
"6463","Leela: No! Everything's just--
",29,2,16
"6464","Bender: Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?. [He starts clearing the garbage disposal.] And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?  Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!
",29,2,16
"6465","Leela: I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?
",29,2,16
"6466","Bender: Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
",29,2,16
"6467","Leela: You're blackmailing me?
",29,2,16
"6468","Bender: ""Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool. [Leela narrows her eye and pulls out a meat cleaver.] Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?
",29,2,16
"6469","Leela: OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum. [She sighs.] Now to dispose of the body.
",29,2,16
"6470","Amy: Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all.
",29,2,16
"6471","Leela: Do you have any gum?

"6477","Scruffy: I've never seen you before neither.
",29,2,16
"6478","Zoidberg: Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer! [Everyone except Leela gasps. She gasps theatrically.] You see, the killer left one fatal clue: This boot print on the Professor's lab coat.
",29,2,16
"6479","Leela: Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. [She unzips her boots and lifts her feet onto the table and twiddles her toes.] See?
",29,2,16
"6480","Fry: Ew! What smells like boot feet?
",29,2,16
"6481","Cubert: This is preposterous. Obviously, the murderer is--
",29,2,16
"6482","Zoidberg: My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse.
",29,2,16
"6483","Scruffy: Scruffy knows who killed them people. In Scruffy's opinion, it were--
",29,2,16
"6484","Zoidberg: So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable! [Nibbler squeals and points at Leela. The lights go off and Leela stabs Nibbler. They come back on and Nibbler is sandwiched between Scruffy and Cubert. An envelope comes through the door. Zoidberg reads the letter inside.] A letter from Bender, my good friend. [reading] Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was-- [He looks up from the letter.] My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--
",29,2,16
"6485","Fry: I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV.
",29,2,16

",29,2,16
"6487","Fry: Whatcha eating?
",29,2,16
"6488","Leela: [eating] Lobster. Want some?
",29,2,16
"6489","Fry: Sure. [He picks up one of Zoidberg's claws, dips it in sauce and takes a bite.] Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths.
",29,2,16

",29,2,16
"6491","Fry: Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?

",29,2,16
"6495","Fry: Then ... then ... it was you!
",29,2,16
"6496","Leela: [crying] I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
",29,2,16
"6497","Fry: Well, that covers the first three killings.
",29,2,16
"6498","Leela: And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!
",29,2,16
"6499","Leela: So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?
",29,2,16
"6500","Fry: I like it!
",29,2,16
"6501","Leela: Good. Now let me just get the lights.
",29,2,16
"6502","Fry: I really like it!
",29,2,16
"6503","Farnsworth: Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
",29,2,16
"6504","Fry: Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?
",29,2,16
"6505","Leela: You idiot! We already saw that.
",29,2,16
"6506","Fry: I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
",29,2,16
"6507","Farnsworth: We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
",29,2,16
"6508","Fry: Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?
",29,2,16
"6509","Farnsworth: That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way. [He turns to the What-If machine.] What would happen if Fry never came to the future?
",29,2,16
"6510","Fry: Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! [He sits down in the chair, puts his feet on the desk and opens a can of beer.] Here's to another lousy Millennium! [He blows the noise maker and tips back on the chair. He loses his balance, falls and hits his head on a freezer.] Ow! [The dial on the machine sets itself. He rubs his head and holds up the noise maker.] I should have left you floating in the toilet!

"6511","Leela: What is it?
",29,2,16
"6512","Farnsworth: It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.

"6516","Fry: You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?
",29,2,16
"6517","Panucci: There's only three real monsters, kid: Dracula, Blacula and Son of Kong. Now quit picking your nose and knead that dough! [Fry sighs. Stephen Hawking rolls in.] Hey! The usual, Professor Hawking?

"6544","Nichols: It's about that rip in space-time that you saw.
",29,2,16
"6545","Hawking: I call it a ""Hawking Hole"".
",29,2,16
"6546","Fry: No fair! I saw it first!
",29,2,16
"6547","Hawking: Who is The Journal of Quantum Physics going to believe?
",29,2,16
"6548","Gygax: Mr. Fry, the time disruption indicates that some of that was supposed to happen but didn't, due to a quantum fluctuation.
",29,2,16
"6549","Nichols: That's why we had to beat you with tennis rackets.
",29,2,16
"6550","Gore: If we don't go back there and make the event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed! And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.
",29,2,16
"6551","Fry: So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
",29,2,16
"6552","Hawking: I call it a ""Hawking Chamber"".
",29,2,16
"6553","Fry: But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head.
",29,2,16
"6554","Gore: Well it's obvious what should have happened: That wang to the head should have killed you.
",29,2,16
"6555","Fry: Uh, what?
",29,2,16
"6556","Nichols: Let's finish the job.
",29,2,16
"6557","Gore: No! Wait! There must be a peaceful--
",29,2,16
"6558","Hawking: Hold him down.
",29,2,16
"6559","Deep Blue: Check.
",29,2,16
"6560","Fry: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
",29,2,16
"6561","Nichols: Something's wrong. Murder isn't working and that's all we're good at.
",29,2,16
"6562","Gygax: Let's try something else. Maybe we should--
",29,2,16
"6563","Gore: Put the dice away before I take them away.
",29,2,16
"6564","Nichols: Wait. I'm getting an idea. What if Fry was supposed to get frozen?
",29,2,16
"6565","Hawking: Yes. Shove him in the tube. It was my idea.
",29,2,16
"6566","Bender: Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!
",29,2,16
"6567","Gore: Get in the tube, dummy! We only have a few seconds before the universe is destroyed.
",29,2,16
"6568","Fry: Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
",29,2,16
"6569","Gygax: Here. Take my plus-one mace.
",29,2,16
"6570","Fry: OK, here I go.
",29,2,16
"6571","Gore: You fool! You foolish fool!
",29,2,16
"6572","Fry: Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?
",29,2,16
"6573","Hawking: Great. The entire universe was destroyed.
",29,2,16
"6574","Fry: Destroyed? Then where are we now?
",29,2,16
"6575","Gore: I don't know. But I can darn well tell you where we're not: The universe.
",29,2,16
"6576","Nichols: Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.
",29,2,16
"6577","Gygax: Anyone wanna play Dungeons & Dragons for the next quadrillion years?
",29,2,16
"6578","Fry: Sure.
",29,2,16
"6579","Hawking: I guess.
",29,2,16
"6580","Deep Blue: Pawn to rook 8.
",29,2,16
"6581","Gore: I'm a 10th-level Vice President!
",29,2,16
"6582","Farnsworth: That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of. [He pushes the What-If machine into a bin.] Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success.
",29,2,16
"6583","Fry: Good work.
",29,2,16
"6584","Leela: Congratulations!
",29,2,16
"6585","Amy: Right on, Professor!
",29,2,16
"6586","Farnsworth: So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer. [He sighs.] A man can dream though. A man can dream.
",29,2,16
"6587","Fry: Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham.
",30,2,17
"6588","Bender: And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
",30,2,17
"6589","Clerk: Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie stix and porno mags with your 5% military discount comes to $95. [He hands over the money, picks up his bag and leaves. Fry slaps his gum on the counter and the clerk rings it up.] That'll be 40 cents.
",30,2,17
"6590","Fry: I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
",30,2,17
"6591","Clerk: Well that's only for people in the military.
",30,2,17
"6592","Bender: What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
",30,2,17
"6593","Clerk: Alright, look. Our policy is: If for any reason you're not completely satisfied, I hate you.
",30,2,17
"6594","Bender: OK, now I'm mad!
",30,2,17
"6595","Fry: Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, monsignor.
",30,2,17
"6596","Bender: Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!
",30,2,17
"6597","Recruitment Officer: Sign here on the dotted line, patriots, and I'll give you your discount cards.
",30,2,17
"6598","Fry: Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?
",30,2,17
"6599","Bender: You know, playing you all for chumps?
",30,2,17
"6600","Recruitment Officer: Correct. There's no obligation. [Fry and Bender laugh as they sign. The man takes their papers back.] Unless, of course, war were declared.
",30,2,17
"6601","Fry: What's that?
",30,2,17
"6602","Recruitment Officer: War were declared.
",30,2,17
"6603","Farnsworth: Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage.
",30,2,17
"6604","Hermes: I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now.
",30,2,17
"6605","Leela: I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
",30,2,17
"6606","Zapp: Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only policy.
",30,2,17
"6607","Leela: What?
",30,2,17
"6608","Zapp: It's shameful, I agree. In the olden days, I proudly fought alongside female troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, after a series of deadly blunders caused by distracting low-cut fatigues and lots of harmless pinching, the army decided women weren't fit for service. Not when I'm in charge.
",30,2,17
"6609","Leela: You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.
",30,2,17
"6610","Zapp: If it's a lesson in love, watch out; I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What do I call it, Kif?
",30,2,17
"6611","Kif: ""Sex-lexia"".
",30,2,17
"6612","Zapp: Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all be fighting for your planet. Many of you will be dying for your planet. A few of you will be forced through a fine mesh screen for your planet. They will be the luckiest of all.
",30,2,17
"6613","Bender: Great, we're gonna die.
",30,2,17
"6614","Fry: And this ham gum is all bones.
",30,2,17
"6615","Zapp: Now to present the logistics of our mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth President Richard M. Nixon.
",30,2,17
"6616","Nixon: This is the brass ring, fellas. [Kif presses a button, the lights dim and a holographic image of a planet appears above the soldiers.] Planet Spheron One!
",30,2,17
"6617","Fry: Cool effect!
",30,2,17
"6618","Zapp: It's a desolate, ugly little planet with absolutely no natural resources or strategic value. Questions?
",30,2,17
"6619","Soldier #1: Why is this Godforsaken planet worth dying for?
",30,2,17
"6620","Zapp: Don't ask me, you're the one who's going to be dying.
",30,2,17
"6621","Fry: Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?
",30,2,17
"6622","Zapp: A valid question. [The lights come back on.] We know nothing about their language, their history or what they look like. But we can assume this: They stand for everything we don't stand for. Also, they told me you guys look like dorks.
",30,2,17
"6623","Bender: They look like dorks!
",30,2,17
"6624","Zapp: What's the matter, private? Tent got your tongue? [chuckling] Tent got your... [talking] Kif, write that down and send it to ""Humor In Uniform"".
",30,2,17
"6625","Fry: Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales!
",30,2,17
"6626","Kif: That new recruit is phenomenal, sir.
",30,2,17
"6627","Zapp: Yes. He edged out my old mark by two seconds ... [Kif frowns.] ... and 16 minutes ... and 12 hours. I do plan to finish someday, Kif. Good hustle, soldier.
",30,2,17
"6628","Leela: [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is.
",30,2,17
"6629","Zapp: As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, I sure do. What's your name, private?
",30,2,17
"6630","Leela: [disguised, deeper voice] Lee-- [She covers her mouth.] La ... man. La Man ... Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir.
",30,2,17
"6631","Zapp: Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a man's man's man. More importantly, your hand, while firm and masculine, is soft as a velvet child. What lotion do you use?
",30,2,17
"6632","Leela: [disguised, deeper voice] Pert and Popular, sir.
",30,2,17
"6633","Zapp: Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of Pert and Popular.
",30,2,17
"6634","Kif: What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?
",30,2,17
"6635","Zapp: Squirt it on some homeless man with dry elbows. [Leela sneaks off.] Private Lee Lemon may well be the finest recruit I've seen in all my years of service. That young man fills me with hope and some other emotions that are weird and deeply confusing to me.
",30,2,17
"6636","Kif: Ew!
",30,2,17
"6637","Zapp: [sexfully] Hello!
",30,2,17
"6638","Nixon: Mmm! Now that's a nice rosé. So, anyway, we open up the panda crate and, wouldn't you know it, the damn thing's dead! Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story.
",30,2,17
"6639","Zapp: Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you were talking about for you.
",30,2,17
"6640","Fry: Mind if we sit with you?
",30,2,17
"6641","Leela: [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.
",30,2,17
"6642","Fry: Good point ... I guess.
",30,2,17
"6643","Bender: You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle.
",30,2,17
"6644","Hick: So. Any you fellas got a special lady back home?
",30,2,17
"6645","Fry: Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with.
",30,2,17
"6646","Leela: Really? [disguised, deeper voice] What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or Cyclops?
",30,2,17
"6647","Fry: Cyclops.
",30,2,17
"6648","Leela: [disguised, deeper voice] Aww, she sounds sweet.
",30,2,17
"6649","Bender: But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--
",30,2,17
"6650","Leela: [disguised, deeper voice] Stop! Stop flattering me!
",30,2,17
"6651","Zapp: [shouting] Ten hut! [Everyone sits to attention.] Well, well, well. If it isn't Lee Lemon: The flaming star of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, Lemon, do you like to read? I just got a great book on tape. It's about life in Ancient Greece and--
",30,2,17
"6652","Leela: [disguised, deeper voice] Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better--
",30,2,17
"6653","Zapp: Shh. Don't talk. Just go.
",30,2,17
"6654","Nixon: We are now in position above Spheron One. This is the moment we were training for all yesterday afternoon.
",30,2,17
"6655","Zapp: And now for the battle plan: As you all know, the key to victory is the element of surprise. Surprise!
",30,2,17
"6656","Fry: It's creepy here.
",30,2,17
"6657","Soldier #1: This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
",30,2,17
"6658","Fry: And then the battle's not so bad?
",30,2,17
"6659","Soldier #1: Oh, right. I forgot about the battle.
",30,2,17
"6660","Fry: What's happening?
",30,2,17
"6661","Hick: Holy shoot! Lookie!
",30,2,17
"6662","Fry: The enemy! They're balls!
",30,2,17
"6663","Leela: Charge your gun, Fry.
",30,2,17
"6664","Fry: Oh, right.
",30,2,17
"6665","Zapp: Watch where you're shooting, private! You spooked Felicity. [He pats the horse's neck.] There, there, boy.
",30,2,17
"6666","Soldier #1: [hoarse] Give this to my son.
",30,2,17
"6667","Bender: You got it!
",30,2,17
"6668","Soldier #1: [hoarse] Wait. I didn't tell you where he lives.
",30,2,17
"6669","Bender: Hey, I think your son might also like those boots.
",30,2,17
"6670","Hick: Cover us, buddy. You've got the only wounded-up positron shooter. [Fry quivers behind a rock as balls bounce towards him. He screams, blasts a hole in the ground and hides in it. The balls bounce past.] Fry, you emu-bellied coward!
",30,2,17
"6671","Fry: [shouting] Bender! No!
",30,2,17
"6672","Bender: If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender.

",30,2,17

",30,2,17
"6679","iHawk: Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!
",30,2,17

",30,2,17
"6681","iHawk: When will the killing end?
",30,2,17
"6682","Zapp: Look at this sissy, Kif. While others were fighting and dying pointlessly, he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in a pool of his own cowardice.
",30,2,17
"6683","Fry: That wasn't cowardice.
",30,2,17
"6684","Zapp: I'm de-promoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?
",30,2,17
"6685","Kif: Being your assistant.
",30,2,17
"6686","Zapp: Wrong! Being your assistant! Private Fry, you shall henceforth serve as Kif's assistant.
",30,2,17
"6687","Fry: That doesn't sound too bad.
",30,2,17

",30,2,17
"6692","iHawk: Believe it all you want, that won't make it true. [He laughs then flicks his switch from ""irreverent"" to ""maudlin"".] This isn't a war, it's a murder. [He flicks it back.] This isn't a war, it's a moider!
",30,2,17
"6693","Hick: Bender, old buddy, hang in there.
",30,2,17
"6694","Zapp: Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen since my mirror got grease on it. I hereby order that in Bender's honour he be melted down and made into a statue of himself.
",30,2,17

"6707","Nixon: A mission of peace.
",30,2,17
"6708","Bender: [disappointed] Oh!
",30,2,17

",30,2,17

"6714","Nixon: [singing] I'm so dizzy,
My head is spinning,
Like a whirlpool,
It never ends.

",30,2,17
"6719","Zapp: Right! Right! [He walks away and Leela hurries into the stall and shuts the door. Zapp has wrapped the towel around his head and squirts something onto his hand.] I'm about to try the new lotion you recommended.

",30,2,17

",30,2,17

",30,2,17
"6726","Zapp: The one we had the doctors implant in that gullible Bender robot.

",30,2,17

",30,2,17

",30,2,17
"6734","Leela: [disguised, deeper voice] Uh, Commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?
",30,2,17
"6735","Zapp: Of course, my significant soldier. The bomb is voice-activated. It will detonate the instant the robot unwittingly speaks a certain word.
",30,2,17
"6736","Fry: What's the word, uh, sir?
",30,2,17
"6737","Zapp: It's the one word the robot uses more than any other. We got it from this convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used words.

",30,2,17
"6753","Zapp: So it's you I've been attracted to! Oh, God, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman.
",30,2,17
"6754","Leela: Let's do it again sometime.
",30,2,17
"6755","Brain Ball #2: The Elders tell of a young ball much like you. He bounced three metres in the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres in the air. Then he bounced four metres in the air. Do I make myself clear?
",30,2,17
"6756","Kissenger: Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the same story. Oy.
",30,2,17
"6757","Bender: These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?
",30,2,17
"6758","Kissenger: This isn't a productive area of discussion.
",30,2,17
"6759","Leela: We're here. I followed the bouncing balls. [Fry stands at the door with a parachute on his back.] I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
",30,2,17
"6760","Fry: OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. [He puts on his helmet and sighs.] Will you push me?
",30,2,17
"6761","Leela: [shouting] I already did!
",30,2,17
"6762","Fry: [shouting] Thank you! [He pulls his ripcord and hits the ground as soon as the parachute deploys. Balls bounce on him and he kicks a few away and rides one like a space hopper.] At last, war has made me into a man.
",30,2,17
"6763","Kissenger: Please, gentlemen, we must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks.
",30,2,17
"6764","Brain Ball #1: We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh variety.
",30,2,17
"6765","Bender: Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say. [He climbs onto the table and turns around.] Bite my shiny metal--
",30,2,17
"6766","Fry: Stop! You can't say the next word.
",30,2,17
"6767","Bender: Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch.
",30,2,17
"6768","Fry: Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!
",30,2,17
"6769","Kissenger: Young man, you have the bravery of a hero and breath as fresh as a summer ham. [Fry smiles and Bender laughs.] What? What is funny?
",30,2,17
"6770","Bender: Bender's got the upper hand now. [He closes his door and turns to the Brain Balls.] The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"". [Everyone gasps.] I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!
",30,2,17
"6771","Brain Ball #1: Please, stay calm. There's no need to bounce of the handle.
",30,2,17
"6772","Bender: That's it, I'm saying it! ""A"" is for--
",30,2,17
"6773","Brain Ball #1: Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's demands. The war is over. Our home planet is yours.
",30,2,17
"6774","Fry: Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?
",30,2,17
"6775","Brain Ball #2: Correct.
",30,2,17
"6776","Bender: Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson: Don't mess with Earth.
",30,2,17
"6777","Brain Ball #1: May you bounce in peace.
",30,2,17
"6778","Bender: Get the hell off my planet.
",30,2,17
"6779","Farnsworth: Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. [shouting] Wake up!
",30,2,17
"6780","Bender: Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?
",30,2,17
"6781","Zoidberg: I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
",30,2,17
"6782","Farnsworth: It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know.
",30,2,17
"6783","Bender: [ironic] Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""? [He gasps.] Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!
",30,2,17
"6784","Leela: We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
",30,2,17
"6785","Amy: It's from the list of words you almost never say.
",30,2,17
"6786","Bender: That's using your ass. So, what's the word?
",30,2,17
"6787","Hermes: We think it's better if you don't know.
",30,2,17
"6788","Bender: Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it ""please""?
",30,2,17
"6789","Fry: No.
",30,2,17
"6790","Bender: Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!
",30,2,17
"6791","Leela: Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.
",30,2,17
"6792","Bender: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Fun-derful""? Uh, ""non-alcoholic""?
",30,2,17
"6793","Amy: Quit it!
",30,2,17
"6794","Fry: Bender!
",30,2,17
"6795","Hermes: Stop it, mon!
",30,2,17
"6796","Zoidberg: Enough already!
",30,2,17
"6797","Bender: [from lab] ""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""? [There is an explosion.] I'm alright!
",30,2,17
"6798","Doctorbot: Notify his survivors.
",31,2,18
"6799","Bender: [singing] B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! [He walks into the room. Leela and Amy read magazines and Fry looks at a copy of Playbot. Bender dances.] B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--
",31,2,18
"6800","Hermes: Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue. Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and, Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet.
",31,2,18
"6801","Leela: You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
",31,2,18
"6802","Hermes: And for Bender-- Uh-oh! A black-bordered envelope.
",31,2,18
"6803","Amy: Oh, no! Someone you know must've died.
",31,2,18
"6804","Bender: I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck! [He opens the envelope and gasps.] Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir.
",31,2,18
"6805","Fry: Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?
",31,2,18
"6806","Bender: Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will. [He screws up the letter and throws it behind him.] Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated! [He walks through the door then comes back.] C'mon, it'll be fun!
",31,2,18
"6807","Bender: Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?
",31,2,18
"6808","Robot #1: Some say unholy things happen up there.
",31,2,18
"6809","Robot #2: For example: All of us say that.
",31,2,18
"6810","Farnsworth: Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
",31,2,18
"6811","Robot #2: Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! With all your modern science are you any closer to understanding the mystery of how a robot walks or talks?
",31,2,18
"6812","Farnsworth: Yes, you idiot. [He opens the robot's chest cabinet.] The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case.
",31,2,18
"6813","Robot #2: I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe.
",31,2,18
"6814","Robot #2: I will go this far and no further.
",31,2,18
"6815","Preacherbot: I now commend Vladimir's remains to the earth. Filings to filings; rust to rust.
",31,2,18
"6816","Execu-Tor: [reading] To my loyal butler, You There, for his decades of service, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal instalments of one-twentieth of a pittance each. [You There bursts into tears.] To my lazy, spoiled son, Tandy, who never learned the value of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million fortune.
",31,2,18
"6817","Tandy: [whispering] Is that a lot?
",31,2,18
"6818","Execu-Tor: [reading] And to my loving nephew, Bender, assuming he's not responsible for my death, I leave my castle.
",31,2,18
"6819","Bender: Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
",31,2,18
"6820","Execu-Tor: [reading] On condition that he spend one night within its walls.
",31,2,18
"6821","Bender: Oh, man, there's always a catch!
",31,2,18
"6822","Bender: Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be--
",31,2,18
"6823","Leela: What is it?
",31,2,18
"6824","Bender: That painting, the eyes are watching me!
",31,2,18
"6825","Farnsworth: Hmm. [He traces his glass backwards and forwards in front of the picture. The eyes follow the glass.] It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
",31,2,18
"6826","Bender: So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although-- [The MS Windows intro music plays, as if from nowhere. Someone laughs.] What's that?
",31,2,18
"6827","Zoidberg: I don't know, but it's infectious!
",31,2,18
"6828","Bender: No doubt about it, this place is haunted.
",31,2,18
"6829","Hermes: Don't be silly, mon. The last ghost died over 200 years ago.
",31,2,18
"6830","Bender: The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
",31,2,18
"6831","Leela: [reading] 0101100101. [talking] What does it mean?
",31,2,18
"6832","Bender: It's just gibberish. [He turns and gasps as he sees the numbers reflected in a mirror à la The Shining.] [reading] 1010011010?
",31,2,18
"6833","Bender: Uncle Vladimir!
",31,2,18
"6834","Vladimir-Ghost: Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!
",31,2,18
"6835","Bender: That's what they said about being alive.
",31,2,18
"6836","Robot Ghosts: [chanting] Join us! Join us! Join us, Bender!
",31,2,18
"6837","Farnsworth: Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms.
",31,2,18
"6838","Hermes: Of course! It was so obvious!
",31,2,18
"6839","Farnsworth: Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of.
",31,2,18
"6840","Bender: [screaming] Nooo!
",31,2,18
"6841","Fry: Bender, wake up! [Bender mumbles as he starts to come around.] He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?
",31,2,18
"6842","Leela: Bender, what happened?
",31,2,18
"6843","Bender: Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
",31,2,18
"6844","Fry: Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount.
",31,2,18
"6845","Amy: Maybe he has. Look at these tracks.
",31,2,18
"6846","Leela: I think Bender may be telling the truth.
",31,2,18
"6847","Zoidberg: Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!
",31,2,18
"6848","Bender: Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over.
",31,2,18
"6849","Zoidberg: Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true.
",31,2,18
"6850","Leela: Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York. [She drops a newspaper onto the table. The headline ""Hit And Run"" dominates the front page.] There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
",31,2,18
"6851","Bender: Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here.
",31,2,18
"6852","Hermes: Bender, mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby.
",31,2,18
"6853","Bender: Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this: [crying] I scared!
",31,2,18
"6854","Vandal #1: I don't know which I like more: Smashing cars or smashing faces.
",31,2,18
"6855","Vandal #2: Well, lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. Now come on, we got church tomorrow. [The grey car quietly follows them. It rolls over a manhole cover and quickly parks.] Did you hear something?
",31,2,18
"6856","Vandal #1: Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset.
",31,2,18
"6857","Vandal #2: That don't sound like no golden marmoset I ever heard.
",31,2,18
"6858","Vandal #1: Made it!
",31,2,18
"6859","Vandal #2: So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?
",31,2,18
"6860","Bender: Where--? What the--? [He tastes it.] Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
",31,2,18
"6861","Sal: Gets outta here, yous lousy bum!
",31,2,18
"6862","Bender: Please, I'm scared.
",31,2,18
"6863","Sal: We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade? Now beat it!
",31,2,18
"6864","Bender: I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet.
",31,2,18
"6865","Fry: Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps.
",31,2,18
"6866","Bender: No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown.
",31,2,18
"6867","Fry: Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!
",31,2,18
"6868","Bender: You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense.
",31,2,18
"6869","Bender: Damn the expense!
",31,2,18
"6870","Gypsy: My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmare-ish life of unremitting horror!
",31,2,18
"6871","Bender: Phew!
",31,2,18
"6872","Gypsy: For, you see, you are a were-car.
",31,2,18
"6873","Bender: A were-car?
",31,2,18
"6874","Gypsy: The car that ran you down on the moors was also a were-car. It beamed a virus to you through its demonic headlights.
",31,2,18
"6875","Leela: That's crazy!
",31,2,18
"6876","Gypsy: Yes. So crazy that it must be true! Each midnight, when your clock resets to zero, your hardware reconfigures into a murderous, four-wheeled car.
",31,2,18
"6877","Bender: I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
",31,2,18
"6878","Gypsy: Yes. But you must be willing to pay a terrible price.
",31,2,18
"6879","Bender: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",31,2,18
"6880","Gypsy: Follow me.
",31,2,18
"6881","Gypsy: According to this ancient read-me file, your only hope is to destroy the original were-car.
",31,2,18
"6882","Bender: I'm with you.
",31,2,18
"6883","Gypsy: In its death throes, the dread car will beam out the virus's uninstall program, thus ridding you of the curse.
",31,2,18
"6884","Bender: And otherwise I can never die?
",31,2,18
"6885","Gypsy: Who said that? Sure you can die. You want to die?
",31,2,18
"6886","Bender: No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
",31,2,18
"6887","Gypsy: Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, your attacks will become more gruesome until, one dark night, you are doomed to kill your dearest friend.
",31,2,18
"6888","Fry: I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
",31,2,18
"6889","Gypsy: [pointing] Now go! Go! [She presses against the glass and topples forwards.] Uh, could one of you just-- Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here.
",31,2,18
"6890","Leela: There. No rampaging for you tonight.
",31,2,18
"6891","Bender: Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
",31,2,18
"6892","Leela: Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
",31,2,18
"6893","Fry: It'll be a rich, full day.
",31,2,18
"6894","Leela: Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them.
",31,2,18
"6895","Fry: [shouting] Bender, no!
",31,2,18
"6896","Leela: [shouting] Fry, stay back!
",31,2,18
"6897","Fry: [shouting] You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
",31,2,18
"6898","Fry: I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.
",31,2,18
"6899","Leela: Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
",31,2,18
"6900","Fry: Stop rubbing it in!
",31,2,18
"6901","Bender: Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?
",31,2,18
"6902","Fry: Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?
",31,2,18
"6903","Bender: I tried to run you over?
",31,2,18
"6904","Leela: It was very sweet of you, Bender.
",31,2,18
"6905","Bender: Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two.
",31,2,18
"6906","Fry: Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears.
",31,2,18
"6907","Leela: Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car.
",31,2,18
"6908","Fry: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",31,2,18
"6909","Leela: Cursed, got it.
",31,2,18
"6910","Bender: Whatever.
",31,2,18
"6911","Leela: The tracks lead here.
",31,2,18
"6912","Fry: Thanks, eagle eye.
",31,2,18
"6913","Leela: Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful: Many robots are stupid and violent.
",31,2,18
"6914","Bender: [sarcastic] I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--
",31,2,18
"6915","Yokelbot: Get ye to your houses, ye ignorant villagers.
",31,2,18
"6916","Leela: We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!
",31,2,18
"6917","Yokelbot: Stop! What are ye doing?
",31,2,18
"6918","Bender: We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk.
",31,2,18
"6919","Yokelbot: Ye think me be he?
",31,2,18
"6920","Bender: Sí.
",31,2,18
"6921","Yokelbot: Nee. I mean, ""no"". I was given the curse many a year ago while on a bird-watching trip to the Arctic...
",31,2,18
"6922","Yokelbot: [voice-over] I was attacked by a vicious, motorised sled. The natives called it ""The Abominable Snowmobile"".
",31,2,18
"6923","Inuitbot: Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school.
",31,2,18
"6924","Fry: I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
",31,2,18
"6925","Inuitbot: Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original were-car. I received the curse while taking a learning annex class from a famous robot actor.
",31,2,18
"6926","Inuitbot: [voice-over] You know him as Calculon.
",31,2,18
"6927","Calculon: [melodramatically] Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.
",31,2,18
"6928","Bender: Let's kick him some more.
",31,2,18
"6929","Calculon: No, wait, let me explain. [melodramatically] It all began one fateful night a thousand years ago.
",31,2,18
"6930","Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!
",31,2,18
"6931","Calculon: Lies! I change my identity and upgrade my appearance every few decades to avoid suspicion. I was all of history's great acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, David Duchovny!
",31,2,18
"6932","Fry: Look, are you the original were-car or not?
",31,2,18
"6933","Calculon: No, but you are nearing the end of your search. For, you see, I was attacked by the original were-car.
",31,2,18
"6934","Bender: Give us a name, MacButt!
",31,2,18
"6935","Calculon: The year was 2019, and I was just a lowly robot arm...
",31,2,18
"6936","Calculon: [voice-over] ...working in an automotive research lab. I was working on Project Satan ... [He puts a door onto the side of a red car.] ... a savage, intelligent military vehicle built from the most evil parts of the most evil cars in all the world. The steering wheel from Hitler's staff car, the left-turn signal from Charles Manson's VW, the windshield wipers from that car that played Knight Rider.
",31,2,18
"6937","Fry: Knight Rider wasn't evil.
",31,2,18
"6938","Calculon: His windshield wipers were. It didn't come up much in the show though. Anyway...
",31,2,18
"6939","Calculon: [melodramatically; voice-over] Only after bringing Project Satan to life did they discover they had made a horrible mistake. [A man turns the key in the ignition.] For, you see, it was pure evil.
",31,2,18
"6940","Leela: So what happened to Project Satan?
",31,2,18
"6941","Calculon: [voice-over] It's either in Paris, or much more likely...
",31,2,18
"6942","Calculon: [voice-over] ...still in the abandoned automotive lab.
",31,2,18
"6943","Leela: You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
",31,2,18
"6944","Bender: [whispering] Psst, there it is.
",31,2,18
"6945","Leela: It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan? [It growls feebly.] Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
",31,2,18
"6946","Project Satan: You do?
",31,2,18
"6947","Leela: Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?
",31,2,18
"6948","Project Satan: Misery? What misery? I love killing people! Squishing them till their organs squirt out like chunky mustard.
",31,2,18
"6949","Bender: Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends.
",31,2,18
"6950","Leela: Oh, no! It's midnight.
",31,2,18
"6951","Bender: Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!
",31,2,18

",31,2,18
"6954","Leela: Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!
",31,2,18
"6955","Project Satan: That's right! Thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s electric motor, the most evil propulsion system ever conceived! [Bender completes his transformation and Project Satan pulls up beside him.] Take whichever one you want.

"6956","Bender: Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!
",31,2,18
"6957","Fry: [gasping] Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy! [Bender rams Fry's legs twice. Fry tumbles onto Bender's roof, through the sunroof and inside Bender. The seatbelt comes around him.] [talking] Oh, thanks, Bender. [The seatbelt chokes him.] [choking] Too tight! Too tight!
",31,2,18
"6958","Leela: Whoa!
",31,2,18
"6959","Bender: Uh-oh.
",31,2,18
"6960","Leela: Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?
",31,2,18
"6961","Bender: [crying] I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
",31,2,18
"6962","Fry: Bender, I'm alive! [He climbs out.] You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters. [He opens a beer.] Here's to you.
",31,2,18
"6963","Bender: Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!
",31,2,18
"6964","Fry: I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!
",31,2,18
"6965","Fry: Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace.
",32,2,19
"6966","Bender: Tough luck!
",32,2,19
"6967","Fry: Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?
",32,2,19
"6968","Bender: [pointing] Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.
",32,2,19
"6969","Fry: Do you think we should?
",32,2,19
"6970","Bender: [firmly] Yes, I do.
",32,2,19
"6971","Farnsworth: Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?
",32,2,19
"6972","Leela: [patting her pockets] I must've left them onboard.
",32,2,19
"6973","Farnsworth: Eh, wha? I mean, what?
",32,2,19
"6974","Leela: Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
",32,2,19
"6975","Amy: Oh, no!
",32,2,19
"6976","Hermes: Sweet ghost of Babylon.
",32,2,19
"6977","Zoidberg: This isn't good for Zoidberg!
",32,2,19
"6978","Fry: Woo, yeah!
",32,2,19
"6979","Bender: Woo-hoo!
",32,2,19
"6980","Bender: Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!
",32,2,19
"6981","Fry: That's the best thing I ever saw!
",32,2,19
"6982","Italian #1: You stink!
",32,2,19
"6983","Italian #1: Alright, yeah!
",32,2,19
"6984","Italian #2: We like you a lot!
",32,2,19
"6985","Fry: That was great!
",32,2,19
"6986","Bender: And no one suspects a thing! [He laughs and gasps when he sees the rest of the staff standing angrily at the bottom of the steps.] Whoa! [A wall collapses.] And that's how we learned our lesson!
",32,2,19
"6987","Farnsworth: You've gone too far this time -- all three of you!
",32,2,19
"6988","Leela: What did I do?
",32,2,19
"6989","Farnsworth: You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?
",32,2,19
"6990","Fry: Yeah, Leela.
",32,2,19
"6991","Bender: We're all very disappointed in you.
",32,2,19
"6992","Farnsworth: I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted.
",32,2,19
"6993","Hermes: You're all fired.
",32,2,19
"6994","Zoidberg: [waving] Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you. [They round a corner and hear Zoidberg talking to the others through a hole in the wall.] Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!
",32,2,19
"6995","Farnsworth: Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.
",32,2,19
"6996","Amy: Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking, do you think we could go out?
",32,2,19
"6997","Farnsworth: So, Zoidberg, what's new?
",32,2,19
"6998","Hermes: Tell me, Zoidberg: Is it carapace or carapass?
",32,2,19
"6999","Zoidberg: Oh, you know!
",32,2,19
"7000","Fry: What are we supposed to do for money? [He opens his wallet.] All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ... [He holds it up in a bag.] ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with.
",32,2,19
"7001","Bender: Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund? [Leela slaps his wrist.] Ow!
",32,2,19
"7002","Leela: We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!
",32,2,19
"7003","Fry: Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!
",32,2,19
"7004","Leela: No, we can get jobs.
",32,2,19
"7005","Bender: But we just had jobs!
",32,2,19
"7006","Leela: Fortunately, I still have our old career chips.
",32,2,19
"7007","Fry: Our what?
",32,2,19
"7008","Leela: Career chips. [She holds one up.] You remember? They assign you the job you're best at. [Fry stares blankly.] I tried to give you one and you ran away. [No response.] It's how we met!
",32,2,19
"7009","Fry: And then what happened?
",32,2,19
"7010","Leela: Just give me your hand.
",32,2,19
"7011","Fry: Ow!
",32,2,19
"7012","Leela: Baby! [She clips herself.] Ow!
",32,2,19
"7013","Leela: I'd like to reapply for my old job: Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
",32,2,19
"7014","Ipgee: Oh, I was hoping you would come back! I even saved your poster of a chimp expressing your distaste for Mondays.
",32,2,19
"7015","Leela: Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir.
",32,2,19
"7016","Ipgee: Just put your hand under the scanner so I can verify your career chip. [He takes something out of another drawer and scans Leela's hand. It beeps and he looks at his computer screen.] Calcutta, we have a problem.
",32,2,19

",32,2,19
"7018","Ipgee: Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do you like Mondays?
",32,2,19
"7019","Fry: They're OK.
",32,2,19
"7020","Ipgee: Then we'll have to redecorate your office. How do you feel about it helping to be crazy to work here but not being necessary?
",32,2,19
"7021","Bender: Hey, let's see what it says about me.
",32,2,19
"7022","Ipgee: Welcome aboard, sir.
",32,2,19
"7023","Terry: Remember, when the tube opens, say ... [melodramatically] ... ""Welcome to the world of tomorrow!""
",32,2,19
"7024","Fry: Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up. [The freezer pings and opens. A man walks out, clutching his head.] Bathroom's that way.
",32,2,19
"7025","Fry: So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future.
",32,2,19
"7026","Man: Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare and I figured that time was cyclical.
",32,2,19
"7027","Fry: Nope. Straight line. [His control panel pings.] Ah, the Probulator's done.
",32,2,19
"7028","Man: That wasn't so bad.
",32,2,19
"7029","Fry: Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet. [The machines start making noises and the man screams.] OK, it's about to start.
",32,2,19
"7030","Bender: Welcome to the future, human slave. [The man trembles and Bender laughs.] Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly! [He takes the cape and head off.] I'm a horrible robot! [The man backs into the freezer and Bender walks towards him, turning his head and outstretching his arms.] Kill all humans!
",32,2,19
"7031","Terry: Dear God! He's having a heart attack!
",32,2,19
"7032","Bender: Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future.
",32,2,19
"7033","Terry: We have a cure for it now!
",32,2,19
"7034","Bender: Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this.
",32,2,19
"7035","Fry: Nothing like a power nap.
",32,2,19
"7036","Old Man: Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!
",32,2,19
"7037","Bender: Stay beautiful, doll-face! [The door closes.] That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?
",32,2,19
"7038","Fry: I ordered a pizza.
",32,2,19
"7039","Leela: Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener. [Fry and Bender laugh.] Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.
",32,2,19
"7040","Fry: Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free.
",32,2,19
"7041","Leela: It's only been 23 minutes.
",32,2,19
"7042","Fry: [checking his watch] Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.
",32,2,19
"7043","Chef: It's only been a-23 minutes, you dumb a-cannoli. You got a problem, we can take it outside.
",32,2,19
"7044","Fry: OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him.
",32,2,19
"7045","Leela: Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform.
",32,2,19
"7046","Chef: 35, you stupid meatball.
",32,2,19
"7047","Bender: Who should be unfreeze next?
",32,2,19
"7048","Fry: No. [They pass Weird Al Yankovic.] No! [They move onto the next one.] Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!
",32,2,19
"7049","Bender: Alright!
",32,2,19
"7050","Fry: Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!
",32,2,19
"7051","Shore: Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause trouble in it.
",32,2,19
"7052","Fry: Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!
",32,2,19
"7053","Shore: An unattractive prospect. While researching for the role, I ran computer simulations demonstrating, incontrovertibly, that the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, cube or even a stately tetrahedron, buddy!
",32,2,19
"7054","Fry: Oh. [He coughs.] So, how did you wind up getting frozen?
",32,2,19
"7055","Shore: Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked, and I resolved to freeze the weasel.
",32,2,19
"7056","Fry: The weasel?
",32,2,19
"7057","Shore: Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the thousandth anniversary screening of Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?
",32,2,19
"7058","Fry: I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
",32,2,19
"7059","Shore: Like what?
",32,2,19
"7060","Fry: I love this job.
",32,2,19
"7061","Bender: Me too.
",32,2,19
"7062","Fry: Showtime! [hoarse] I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
",32,2,19
"7063","Bender: Boo?
",32,2,19
"7064","Fry: Michelle!
",32,2,19
"7065","Bender: Oh, my God!
",32,2,19
"7066","Michelle: Fry? Is it really you?
",32,2,19
"7067","Fry: I don't know. Is it really you?
",32,2,19
"7068","Michelle: What do you mean you don't know? Are you you or not?
",32,2,19
"7069","Fry: Who wants to know?
",32,2,19
"7070","Michelle: Oh, Fry, it is you!
",32,2,19
"7071","Fry: I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?
",32,2,19
"7072","Michelle: Oh, Fry. After you left, things took a turn for the worse. I got married.
",32,2,19
"7073","Fry: I'm sorry.
",32,2,19
"7074","Michelle: [voice-over] His name was Charles. He attended a law school so prestigious the basketball team was coached by Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [The flashback changes to Michelle waving Charles off outside one of his classes. The basketball team runs by and Ruth Bader Ginsburg blows a whistle. Then it changes to Michelle being bitten by a pack of barking dogs.] I put him through law school by working as a dog walker for antisocial dogs.
",32,2,19
"7075","Fry: Sorry.
",32,2,19
"7076","Michelle: [voice-over] But soon after Charles graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties.
",32,2,19
"7077","Fry: Uh, sorry.
",32,2,19
"7078","Michelle: [voice-over] Desperately depressed, I turned to the one thing that could lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, a corn dog bone got lodged in the control panel of the Spizzler, and I had to ride it for eight hours.
",32,2,19
"7079","Fry: [voice-over] Sorry.
",32,2,19
"7080","Michelle: [voice-over] But it did give me a chance to think...
",32,2,19
"7081","Fry: I'm sorry.
",32,2,19
"7082","Michelle: And I remembered the last time I was truly happy; when I was with you.
",32,2,19
"7083","Fry: Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
",32,2,19
"7084","Michelle: No, I did it to get a fresh start. I didn't know what had happened to you -- no one did. The police were going to conduct a search but your parents felt it was a waste of taxpayer money.
",32,2,19
"7085","Fry: That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?
",32,2,19
"7086","Michelle: Not really. Except for one person.
",32,2,19
"7087","Fry: Who was it?
",32,2,19
"7088","Michelle: Everything is so different.
",32,2,19
"7089","Fry: Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
",32,2,19
"7090","Michelle: Ew!
",32,2,19
"7091","Michelle: Eurgh.
",32,2,19
"7092","Fry: Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys.
",32,2,19
"7093","Sal: I'm on loan from the Louvre.
",32,2,19
"7094","Leela: Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance.
",32,2,19
"7095","Bender: Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ... [He puts his gorilla mask on.] ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!
",32,2,19
"7096","Farnsworth: I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.
",32,2,19
"7097","Farnsworth: So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?
",32,2,19
"7098","Amy: Great!
",32,2,19
"7099","Hermes: Organised!
",32,2,19
"7100","Zoidberg: For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured.
",32,2,19
"7101","Farnsworth: You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces.
",32,2,19
"7102","Leela: Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
",32,2,19
"7103","Fry: Hey, guys.
",32,2,19
"7104","Leela: Oh, uh, hey, Fry!
",32,2,19
"7105","Bender: So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!
",32,2,19
"7106","Fry: I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle. [Everyone claps.] Michelle, this is Leela. [Michelle screams.] This is Bender. [Michelle screams.] The Professor. [Farnsworth waves. Michelle looks at Fry and he nods. She screams.] Hermes and Amy.
",32,2,19
"7107","Michelle: Nice to meet you.
",32,2,19
"7108","Fry: And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
",32,2,19
"7109","Hermes: Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?
",32,2,19
"7110","Fry: All what?
",32,2,19
"7111","Farnsworth: This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--
",32,2,19
"7112","Bender: A home invasion by a former roommate.
",32,2,19
"7113","Fry: But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.
",32,2,19
"7114","Zoidberg: There you go, dearies.
",32,2,19
"7115","Michelle: It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future.
",32,2,19
"7116","Amy: I'm from Mars.
",32,2,19
"7117","Michelle: [trembling] I feel so out of place here. I don't understand why Fry fits in so well.
",32,2,19
"7118","Leela: [sitting down] Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
",32,2,19
"7119","Michelle: That's true. But I used to fit in really well.
",32,2,19
"7120","Zoidberg: Then good luck, sister.
",32,2,19
"7121","Michelle: Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but your friends are a bunch of freaks.
",32,2,19
"7122","Fry: Yeah, they're great, huh?
",32,2,19
"7123","Michelle: I just don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream that doesn't make me actually vanish. I don't even have a job.
",32,2,19
"7124","Fry: Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed. [He picks up the implant gun.] Hold out your palm. [Michelle whimpers.] What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced.
",32,2,19
"7125","Michelle: This world is horrible. Let's start over, Fry. We'll go someplace where all we have is each other.
",32,2,19
"7126","Fry: Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there.
",32,2,19
"7127","Michelle: It's not a ""there"". It's a ""then"". [She turns a freezer dial to 1000 years.] The future.
",32,2,19
"7128","Fry: Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff.
",32,2,19
"7129","Michelle: I love you. Don't you love me?
",32,2,19
"7130","Fry: Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step.
",32,2,19
"7131","Michelle: Fry, why must you analyse everything with your relentless logic? Nothing matters but our love.
",32,2,19
"7132","Fry: You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
",32,2,19
"7133","Fry: Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it.
",32,2,19
"7134","Fry: The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
",32,2,19
"7135","Michelle: It's not that bad. Fate brought us together and now fate brought us here.
",32,2,19
"7136","Fry: No, you brought us here.
",32,2,19
"7137","Michelle: Whine some more, Fry, I really find that attractive in a man. Now come on, build us a shelter.
",32,2,19
"7138","Fry: Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live.
",32,2,19
"7139","Fry: There!
",32,2,19
"7140","Michelle: You expect me to live in a tiny little hole?
",32,2,19
"7141","Fry: It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher.
",32,2,19
"7142","Michelle: Oh, look! Some little kids.
",32,2,19
"7143","Fry: They'll save us. [The kids point guns at them.] We're saved!
",32,2,19
"7144","Butch: I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took your hole and you can't do nothing about it.
",32,2,19
"7145","Michelle: OK.
",32,2,19
"7146","Fry: Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?
",32,2,19
"7147","Butch: Well, alright. But no interfering with our grand works.
",32,2,19
"7148","Fry: I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him.
",32,2,19
"7149","Michelle: You know your problem, Fry? You're not ambitious. You should be chief.
",32,2,19
"7150","Fry: What do I need, ulcers?
",32,2,19
"7151","Michelle: But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's girlfriend lording it over me with her fancy coyote hide.
",32,2,19
"7152","Fry: Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society.
",32,2,19
"7153","Butch: On what grounds do you challenge my authority?
",32,2,19
"7154","Fry: Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up.
",32,2,19
"7155","Kid #1: Yeah, I'll bet he could.
",32,2,19
"7156","Butch's Girlfriend: He's got arm hair.
",32,2,19
"7157","Butch: Alright, grandpa. There's only one way to settle this: Death rolling!
",32,2,19
"7158","Fry: What's death rolling?
",32,2,19
"7159","Orowheat: It's like skateboarding.
",32,2,19
"7160","Ice-V: Except half the time, someone dies.
",32,2,19
"7161","Fry: Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.
",32,2,19
"7162","Butch: Last one holding the bandana's the new leader.
",32,2,19
"7163","Michelle: My mother always said you were a loser, Fry. Now get out there and prove her wrong.
",32,2,19
"7164","Fry: [sadly] Beth said that?
",32,2,19
"7165","Butch's Girlfriend: Achat, shtayim, shalosh!
",32,2,19
"7166","Butch: It's cool. Back off! [He looks at his bleeding knee.] [crying] My knee. I scraped it!
",32,2,19
"7167","Fry: Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha! [He snatches the bandana and dances around.] I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
",32,2,19

"7170","Butch: Aw, man.
",32,2,19
"7171","Butch's Mom: Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew school.
",32,2,19
"7172","Orowheat: I don't wanna go.
",32,2,19
"7173","Butch's Girlfriend: Every Monday and Wednesday's the same thing.
",32,2,19
"7174","Fry: I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.
",32,2,19
"7175","Michelle: That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.
",32,2,19
"7176","Fry: Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything.
",32,2,19
"7177","Michelle: Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. When we get back to the hole we are going to have a long, boring talk about our relationship!
",32,2,19
"7178","Fry: Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: [whispering] I'm leaving you.
",32,2,19
"7179","Fry: There must be people somewhere.
",32,2,19
"7180","Fry: Yes! Footprints! And hand prints? [The mist clears some more and he sees the foot and hand prints are signed by Clark Gable. Some more signatures appear including those of Florp, Dame Calista Flockhart, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Slurms MacKenzie, Calculon and James Mason.] But? What's happening?
",32,2,19
"7181","Leela: Fry, thank God we found you.
",32,2,19
"7182","Fry: Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
",32,2,19
"7183","Leela: It's not the year 4000.
",32,2,19
"7184","Bender: You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed.
",32,2,19
"7185","Farnsworth: You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
",32,2,19
"7186","Leela: But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch.
",32,2,19
"7187","Fry: So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
",32,2,19
"7188","Farnsworth: You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
",32,2,19
"7189","Fry: But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
",32,2,19
"7190","Leela: Exactly, you're in L.A.
",32,2,19
"7191","Fry: But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
",32,2,19
"7192","Bender: That's L.A. for you.
",32,2,19
"7193","Fry: But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
",32,2,19
"7194","Bender: He just won't stop with the social commentary.
",32,2,19
"7195","Fry: And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it-- [A limo pulls up and the window comes down. Inside, Michelle and Pauly Shore drink champagne.] Michelle, baby!
",32,2,19
"7196","Michelle: It's not working out, Fry.
",32,2,19
"7197","Shore: [shouting] Tis better to have loved and lost, n'est ce-pas?
",32,2,19
"7198","Fry: That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?
",32,2,19
"7199","Farnsworth: Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you.
",32,2,19
"7200","Bender: 'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions.
",32,2,19
"7201","Farnsworth: Oh, that's right. Get lost!
",32,2,19
"7202","Hermes: People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs.
",33,3,1
"7203","Leela: Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?
",33,3,1
"7204","Fry: He's got me beat!
",33,3,1
"7205","Hermes: Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?
",33,3,1
"7206","Leela: Yeah!
",33,3,1
"7207","Bender: Alright, yup.
",33,3,1
"7208","Hermes: All opposed? [No one raises their hand.] All abstaining?
",33,3,1
"7209","Leela: Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
",33,3,1
"7210","Fry: He's dead.
",33,3,1
"7211","Bender: What?
",33,3,1
"7212","Amy: Oh, no!
",33,3,1
"7213","Farnsworth: He always seemed so full of life; laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this.
",33,3,1
"7214","Zoidberg: Why with all the crying? [He looks across the room.] So that's where I left my shell.
",33,3,1
"7215","Leela: I didn't know you could take this thing off.
",33,3,1
"7216","Zoidberg: It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!
",33,3,1
"7217","Farnsworth: Stop doing that!
",33,3,1
"7218","Zoidberg: So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
",33,3,1
"7219","Amy: Those were toenail clippings.
",33,3,1
"7220","Zoidberg: A feast is a feast.
",33,3,1
"7221","Amy: Hey, that's my cellphone!
",33,3,1
"7222","Amy: Hello? [The sound of heavy breathing and gasping comes from the other end.] Hello? Who is this? [The breathing and gasping continues.] Hello? Hello?
",33,3,1
"7223","Leela: What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
",33,3,1
"7224","Amy: Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
",33,3,1
"7225","Leela: Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
",33,3,1
"7226","Amy: I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone. [The phone rings again and she picks it up without hesitation.] Hello?
",33,3,1
"7227","Amy: [on phone] Hello? Is anyone there?
",33,3,1
"7228","Kif: I love you. [He sighs and looks at his wall. It is covered with pictures of Amy and a newspaper clipping of the Titanic disaster. Underneath the headline ""Titanic Survivors"" is a photo of him carrying Amy towards the escape pod. He picks up the phone again and tries to dial but puts the receiver down and huddles over himself on his bed.] Why must I be such a coward?
",33,3,1
"7229","Zapp: Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant, so-- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman. [Kif stops crying.] It's alright. I've always thought myself as a father figure to some of my more pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's rap.
",33,3,1
"7230","Kif: Well, I'm in love with this girl--
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7234","Zapp: [voice-over; proud] Yes! It was in all the papers.

",33,3,1
"7237","Kif: I've finished talking, sir.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7240","Leela: [on screen] Forget it.
",33,3,1
"7241","Zapp: [on screen] Then let the negotiations begin. I propose we go out on 10 dates.

",33,3,1
"7243","Zapp: [on screen] Nine.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7253","Zapp: I'll take it.
",33,3,1
"7254","Zapp: [on screen] We'll meet you tonight for part of dinner and the first half of a movie.
",33,3,1
"7255","Kif: Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates and, um, what if I can't think of anything to say?
",33,3,1
"7256","Zapp: Here's my personal book of pickup lines. [He hands Kif a small black book.] Say as many of them as you can as fast as you can. Don't stop for any reason.
",33,3,1
"7257","Kif: Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.
",33,3,1
"7258","Zapp: Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that. [He takes the box and walks away, eating the candy.] Mmm!
",33,3,1
"7259","Zapp: Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.
",33,3,1
"7260","Leela: Thanks.
",33,3,1
"7261","Zapp: Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly erotic date.
",33,3,1
"7262","Leela: Half-date.
",33,3,1
"7263","Zapp: Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine.
",33,3,1
"7264","Leela: Half-bottle.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7266","Leela: Quarter-shell.
",33,3,1
"7267","Kif: Oh, and I'd like--
",33,3,1
"7268","Zapp: Kif's not hungry. [quietly] Kif, this place is expensive. [talking] I'd like two steaks and the ladies will have some very sensual salads -- with low-cal sensual dressing.

Oh, won't you take me to funkytown.[The song ends and the audience applauds.]
(talking) Thank you.

"7270","Amy: Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night.
",33,3,1
"7271","Kif: Well, um, um ... hello.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7275","Leela: Lieutenant Kroker!
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7281","Zapp: There's only one sure-fire way back into a woman's heart and parts beyond. I speak, of course, of karaoke.
",33,3,1
"7282","Kif: [determined] My years in the DOOP Boys' Chorus will not have been in vain!
",33,3,1
"7283","Leela: Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out.
",33,3,1

But now I'm only falling apart...

",33,3,1
"7286","Kif: [singing] There's nothing I can do,
A total eclipse of the heart--
",33,3,1
"7287","Zapp: Amateur hour's over. [He sits down.] Let me show you why they call me ""The Velour Fog""! Hit it![The jukebox changes to some different music. Zapp smokes a cigarette and starts singing The Kinks' Lola.]
(spoken-word) I met her in a club down in old Soho,
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola,

Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-dum-bum![People get out of their seats and run around screaming.]Leela!
",33,3,1
"7292","Leela: We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
",33,3,1
"7293","Zapp: No need. There's not a restaurant built I can't fly. Where to, ladies?
",33,3,1
"7294","Kif: Please, sir. Let's just divide up the check and--
",33,3,1
"7295","Zapp: Let's see what this eatery can do.
",33,3,1
"7296","Zapp: Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro. [The restaurant shakes.] She's out of control!
",33,3,1
"7297","Zapp: [from inside] You win again, gravity!
",33,3,1
"7298","Zoidberg: Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on, already! [He puts the catalogue on the coffee table and it opens up like a laptop. It emits a holographic stereotypical Mexican shell onto his body.] Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!
",33,3,1
"7299","Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive.
",33,3,1
"7300","Zoidberg: You Latins are so hot-blooded! [He changes the shell and the new one looks like the outfit worn by the cop from The Village People.] This one's like a summer guy!
",33,3,1
"7301","Hermes: Look, you fat fish, the Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell.
",33,3,1
"7302","Fry: I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
",33,3,1
"7303","Operator: [on phone] The number you have dialled has crashed into a planet. Please make a note of it.

",33,3,1
"7315","Kug: Me hear people, but me not see people.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7324","Bender: What kind of moronic plan is that? [They look up. The grass they were hidden in is part of a grass skirt that an Amazonian is wearing.] Wow!

",33,3,1
"7332","Ornik: Men die out many year ago.
",33,3,1
"7333","Bender: With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?
",33,3,1
"7334","Thog: Here stadium, where our women basketball teams play.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7352","Leela: So why did you make it your leader?
",33,3,1
"7353","Ornik: It seemed like different kind of politician.
",33,3,1
"7354","Kug: Not beltway insider.
",33,3,1
"7355","Thog: Femputer, we bring offering of bath beads and scented soaps.
",33,3,1
"7356","Femputer: Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer demands to know why there are men on her planet.

",33,3,1
"7361","Leela: There's no hurry.
",33,3,1
"7362","Zapp: Yes! A little tighter. [She pulls it tighter.] Tighter. Perhaps a hard spanking is in order? [She punches him in the ass and he groans.] Too hard!

",33,3,1
"7364","Leela: [ashamed] I'm afraid so.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7366","Thog: We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But all we have go on are ancient legend and subscription to Cosmo.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7379","Leela: Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of, but most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die.
",33,3,1

",33,3,1
"7413","Fembot: Why? Why? I came here from a faraway planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?

",34,3,2

",34,3,2
"7502","Farnsworth-Droid: Here's the plan: [He turns on a holographic version of Fry's body in the middle of the table.] We'll enter the ear, drip down the back of the throat and make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate the pelvic splanchnic ganglion and cause an intestinal spasm, expelling, among other things, the parasites.
",34,3,2
"7503","Bender-Droid: I'll tell Fry to wash out, among other things, his ear.
",34,3,2
"7504","Farnsworth-Droid: No! Fry can't know anything about the mission. If he finds out, the worms will try to defend themselves. They know everything he knows.

",34,3,2
"7516","Fry: I'd love to!
",34,3,2

",34,3,2
"7523","Fry: Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions. [He hold the flowers out to Leela.] For you.
",34,3,2
"7524","Leela: That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me.
",34,3,2

",34,3,2
"7526","Bender-Droid: We're at finger alert five.

",34,3,2

"7554","Hermes-Droid: But what about the worms in the other parts of his body?
",34,3,2
"7555","Farnsworth-Droid: Listen, this is gonna be one hell of a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be lucky if he has any bones left!

",34,3,2
"7578","Farnsworth-Droid: Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them!

",34,3,2
"7589","Leela: [sexfully] I'll think of something.

He runs along it, slashing nerves as he goes.] Ow! Ow! Ow! [The worms look up and gasp. Fry stands next to a lobe at the end of the catwalk.] Now, the hand-eye co-ordination lobe.

",35,3,3
"7834","Leela: What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself: Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart.
",35,3,3

",35,3,3

"7903","Hairbot: I got your page, Mr. Fry. Your new hair is ready.
",36,3,4
"7904","Amy: So whatever happened to this seven-leaf clover?
",36,3,4
"7905","Fry: I hid it in a secret hiding place whose location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
",36,3,4
"7906","Zoidberg: So the clover is still in the hiding place, maybe?
",36,3,4
"7907","Fry: Hey, yeah! Maybe it is still there. Underground in the ruins of Old New York, helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn its luck around.
",36,3,4
"7908","Farnsworth: Dirt doesn't need luck.
",36,3,4
"7909","Fry: I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?

"7954","Leela: Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st Street.
",36,3,4

",36,3,4
"7957","Bender: Ooh! That feels funny! [Fry and Leela climb onto him and he gets an intercom out of his chest cabinet and speaks into it.] This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.

"7958","Bender: Wake up, buddy. End of the line!
",36,3,4
"7959","Fry: Gosh! My old neighbourhood. [They walk down a deserted street and Fry points at things.] That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!
",36,3,4
"7960","Bender: Was it poorly Xeroxed?
",36,3,4
"7961","Fry: You'd better believe it!
",36,3,4
"7962","Leela: The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from L.A.
",36,3,4
"7963","Mutant: Pardon me, but did I overhear you saying you used to live here?
",36,3,4
"7964","Fry: That's right.
",36,3,4

",36,3,4

",36,3,4

"7982","Mr. Fry: Well he'd better keep his hands off these bananas. Gonna need them when the radiation turns us all into monkeys.
",36,3,4
"7983","Fry: The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back. [He opens the vault, flips through some records and takes one out.] Ah, The Breakfast Club soundtrack. Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff. [He slips the clover into the record sleeve and puts it back into the vault and closes it.] Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday.
",36,3,4
"7984","Fry: This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
",36,3,4

",36,3,4
"7986","Bender: What a waste.
",36,3,4
"7987","Fry: This is it. My Ronco Record Vault. [He blows the dust off it.] I still remember the combination: Three. [He turns the dial and tries to open the door.] It's stuck!
",36,3,4
"7988","Bender: The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me. [He cracks his knuckles, puts his hand on the top of the vault and starts vibrating it. The room starts to shake around them, plaster falls from the ceiling and furniture shakes. Leela looks around. Bender's head vibrates right off his body and lands on the floor. The vault door opens.] There we go!
",36,3,4
"7989","Fry: Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
",36,3,4
"7990","Bender: You mean ""breakfast club sandwich""?
",36,3,4
"7991","Fry: I hid my seven-leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it. [He takes a deep breath.] Here goes. [He reaches into the sleeve.] It's gone! [He takes the record out and sticks his head into the sleeve.] The whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!

",36,3,4
"7995","Fry: I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
",36,3,4

",36,3,4

",36,3,4
"7998","Bender: Who is that God-like figure?
",36,3,4
"7999","Fry: It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it.
",36,3,4
"8000","Leela: Hold the phone. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry?
",36,3,4
"8001","Fry: Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
",36,3,4
"8002","Bender: Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars.
",36,3,4
"8003","Fry: First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life. [He punches the statue.] And now he broke my hand!

"8004","Bender: His legend lives on.
",36,3,4
"8005","Farnsworth: So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
",36,3,4
"8006","Bender: Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.

"8007","Leela: Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on.

"8010","Hermes: First person on Mars? Oh, so your brother was that Philip J. Fry.

"8011","Fry: I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
",36,3,4
"8012","Farnsworth: Shut up, friends. My Internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us. [The staff gather around.] It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries.

"8013","Narrator: [voice-over; in movie] Philip J. Fry: Astronaut, philanthropist, entrepreneur was a great man truly worthy of narration. Fry was the first man on Mars ... [The scene changes to a man planting the American flag on Mars.] ... a feat that has never since been equalled.

",36,3,4
"8017","Narrator: [voice-over; in movie] After a whirlwind fling with Icelandic supermodel Njörd, Fry scored a string of top 10 hits with his rock band Leaf Seven, known for their hypnotic rhythms, driving baselines and memorable hooks.

",36,3,4
"8022","Leela: It will be in a couple hours.

",36,3,4
"8026","Mr. Fry: Yancy, that tux got me through 'Nam in style. [He sighs.] I just wish your brother were still around to see this.
",36,3,4

",36,3,4
"8036","Leela: [reading] Philip Fry, the original Martian.

",36,3,4
"8038","Bender: You're twice the the he ever was.
",36,3,4
"8039","Fry: It's clovering time!
",36,3,4
"8040","Yancy's wife: So, had any ideas for names, Yancy?
",36,3,4
"8041","Yancy: Uh, I'm sorta thinking one. [She hands him the baby.] Daddy has a present for you today. Do you know what it is? [He pulls the clover out of his pocket.] It's a lucky clover that can help you be successful whatever you do -- even breakdancing -- and it once belonged to someone very special.
",36,3,4
"8042","Yancy's wife: I know what name you wanna give him Yancy. It's OK.
",36,3,4
"8043","Yancy: Really? [She nods.] Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honour of my little brother, who I miss every day. I love you, Philip, and I always will.
",36,3,4
"8044","Fry: [reading] Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit.
",36,3,4
"8045","Bender: Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring. [He puts it on and flashes it around.] Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?
",36,3,4
"8046","Leela: Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.
",36,3,4
"8047","Bender: Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
",36,3,4
"8048","Leela: Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash.
",37,3,5
"8049","Bender: Ah!
",37,3,5
"8050","Leela: And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--
",37,3,5
"8051","Bender: Thank you.
",37,3,5
"8052","Leela: But it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
",37,3,5
"8053","Bender: So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
",37,3,5
"8054","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission.
",37,3,5
"8055","Fry: Controversial?
",37,3,5
"8056","Farnsworth: Oh, my, no.
",37,3,5
"8057","Farnsworth: For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.
",37,3,5
"8058","Leela: Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak.
",37,3,5
"8059","Farnsworth: Impossible! [He presses a button and an enlarged holographic cross-section of the tanker appears.] The tanker has 6,000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof. [He points at a new hologram with the fing-longer.] Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors--
",37,3,5
"8060","Leela: Protestors?
",37,3,5
"8061","Farnsworth: Correct. 6,000 hulls.
",37,3,5
"8062","Leela: Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
",37,3,5
"8063","Farnsworth: [whispering] To avoid the tollbooth.
",37,3,5
"8064","Fry: OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going.
",37,3,5
"8065","Leela: At the risk of sounding negative: No! Look, Professor, I can't participate in this mission.
",37,3,5
"8066","Farnsworth: What are you yapping about?
",37,3,5
"8067","Leela: This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors.
",37,3,5
"8068","Farnsworth: This is an outrage! I demand you hand over your captain's jacket.
",37,3,5
"8069","Leela: This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
",37,3,5
"8070","Farnsworth: I said hand it over! [She takes it off, throws it at him and storms out.] Well, Fry, or should I say Captain Fry? [He holds the jacket out to him then pulls it away.] No, I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!
",37,3,5
"8071","Fry: Bender?
",37,3,5
"8072","Farnsworth: That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job.
",37,3,5
"8073","Bender: Well, I do think of human life as expendable.
",37,3,5
"8074","Fry: No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.
",37,3,5
"8075","Zoidberg: Ooh! The new one's out!
",37,3,5
"8076","Bender: Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic. [He puts a blue Napoleon-like hat on and stands up.] Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!
",37,3,5
"8077","Waterfall Sr.: Greetings, Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall Sr., founder of Penguins Unlimited. [The crowd applauds.] Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time you clap your hands you kill thousands of spores that'll some day form a nutritious fungus. Just show your approval with a mould-friendly thumbs up. [The crowd thumbs-ups.] Please hold your thumbs until the end. Now, folks, it's time to stop that tanker with a non-violent human circle.
",37,3,5
"8078","Leela: [standing up] Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
",37,3,5
"8079","Waterfall Sr.: Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too.
",37,3,5
"8080","Bender: Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men.
",37,3,5
"8081","Fry: I am at ease.
",37,3,5
"8082","Bender: Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!
",37,3,5
"8083","Fry: The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?
",37,3,5
"8084","Bender: I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
",37,3,5
"8085","Fry: Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.
",37,3,5
"8086","Bender: Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table
",37,3,5
"8087","Zoidberg: [whispering] The captain's table! What an honour!
",37,3,5
"8088","Waterfall Sr.: Our peace ring has 'em trapped like a tiger in a washing machine!
",37,3,5
"8089","Leela: Get ready!
",37,3,5
"8090","Protestor #1: Look out!
",37,3,5
"8091","Protestor #2: Hold on!
",37,3,5
"8092","Waterfall Sr.: Here they come!
",37,3,5
"8093","Leela: When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?
",37,3,5
"8094","Waterfall Sr.: No, I did not.
",37,3,5
"8095","Waterfall Sr.: Folks, that tanker gave us the slip, but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto. If you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. It's nature's long johns. [He picks up some snow, puts his hand down his trousers and rubs it around.] If rubbing frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey, I don't wanna be right!
",37,3,5
"8096","Waterfall Sr.: This here is our penguin preserve.
",37,3,5
"8097","Leela: Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
",37,3,5
"8098","Waterfall Sr.: We use hand puppets around the young'uns to simulate a natural environment.
",37,3,5
"8099","Leela: That's adorable!
",37,3,5
"8100","Bender: But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it.
",37,3,5
"8101","Zoidberg: Brilliant!
",37,3,5
"8102","Fry: Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!
",37,3,5
"8103","Bender: Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?
",37,3,5
"8104","Fry: Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ... [Bender swirls his glass around.] ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt.
",37,3,5
"8105","Bender: Eh, I've heard better.
",37,3,5
"8106","Fry: If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
",37,3,5
"8107","Bender: Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!
",37,3,5
"8108","Fry: Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
",37,3,5
"8109","Bender: Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.
",37,3,5
"8110","Zoidberg: You can drink with me maybe?
",37,3,5
"8111","Bender: I don't feel like drinking.
",37,3,5
"8112","Zoidberg: Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it. [Bender walks through it.] Three.
",37,3,5
"8113","Bender: [singing] Oh, Greenland is a barren land,
A land that bears no green,
Where there's ice and snow,
And the whale fishes blow,
And the--
",37,3,5
"8114","Zoidberg: Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function.
",37,3,5
"8115","Bender: [sober] Gah! I once knew a guy ... you look like him. But he wasn't either. [His hat tumbles off and he groans.] I'm a good captain.
",37,3,5
"8116","Zoidberg: Please, sir, I love you like a father!
",37,3,5
"8117","Protestor #3: Here they come. Oh, I hope they read my sign!
",37,3,5
"8118","Leela: Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
",37,3,5
"8119","Protestor #3: He must be talking on a cell phone!
",37,3,5
"8120","Fry: What's happening?
",37,3,5
"8121","Zoidberg: All 6,000 hulls have been breached!
",37,3,5
"8122","Fry: Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?
",37,3,5
"8123","Linda: [solemn; on TV] Continuing our coverage of a tragic [upbeat] but far away [solemn] story. The crisis on Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads throughout the penguin habitat. The images are truly horrific.
",37,3,5
"8124","Leela: [on TV] I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel.
",37,3,5
"8125","Morbo: [on TV] Oily humanoid! [Linda chuckles.] At the time of the crash, the tanker captain had an alcohol level of .08 percent -- well below the legal limit for robots.
",37,3,5
"8126","Hyper-Chicken: Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
",37,3,5
"8127","Bender: Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?
",37,3,5
"8128","Hyper-Chicken: I'd have done better but it's plum hard pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial for that there incompetence!
",37,3,5
"8129","Bender: Yeah, uh, good luck with that.
",37,3,5
"8130","Leela: Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
",37,3,5
"8131","Waterfall Sr.: Good way to avoid frostbite, folks: Put your hands between your buttocks. That's nature's pocket.
",37,3,5
"8132","Leela: Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender.
",37,3,5
"8133","Waterfall Sr.: Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.
",37,3,5
"8134","Bender: Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!
",37,3,5
"8135","Leela: Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished? [She runs her finger over a penguin's black feathers.] And clean the black parts too.
",37,3,5
"8136","Smitty: Are they black with white feathers or white with black feathers?
",37,3,5
"8137","URL: It don't matter, baby, they're all beautiful!
",37,3,5
"8138","Bender: Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? [He sees them hugging.] Oh, ho! What's this?
",37,3,5
"8139","URL: Aw, man! He got away!
",37,3,5
"8140","Smitty: I guess this is why Chief says no hugging.
",37,3,5
"8141","Waterfall Sr.: Good work, everyone. I suggest you all go get some sleep. Me, well, I'm gonna stay up all night singing songs about penguins in a fine, piercing tenor.
",37,3,5
"8142","Leela: Has anyone seen Bender? [shouting] Bender? [She pats her knee.] Here robot, robot, robot.
",37,3,5
"8143","Leela: Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?
",37,3,5
"8144","Zoidberg: They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job. [Yolk drips from his mouth.] [ashamed] And eating penguin eggs.
",37,3,5
"8145","Fry: You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?
",37,3,5
"8146","Zoidberg: Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain.
",37,3,5
"8147","Leela: I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
",37,3,5
"8148","Fry: He didn't?
",37,3,5
"8149","Leela: No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him.
",37,3,5
"8150","Fry: Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. [He puts on Leela's jacket and Bender's hat.] To the ship.
",37,3,5
"8151","Leela: Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
",37,3,5
"8152","Fry: Madam, I am in command now.
",37,3,5
"8153","Zoidberg: Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would.
",37,3,5
"8154","Bender: What the--? [The penguins and he dive into some water. Bender comes up to the surface.] What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!
",37,3,5
"8155","Penguin #1: [in penguin] Full of fish?
",37,3,5
"8156","Bender: [in penguin] Not entirely.
",37,3,5
"8157","Penguin #1: [in penguin] Then let's fish.
",37,3,5
"8158","Zoidberg: Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it.
",37,3,5
"8159","Fry: Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
",37,3,5
"8160","Zoidberg: [shouting] Stop yelling at me!
",37,3,5
"8161","Waterfall Sr.: Folks, it's worse than we thought. Seems dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's like a perverted trail mix of penguin oestrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile.
",37,3,5
"8162","Leela: How ultra?
",37,3,5
"8163","Waterfall Sr.: Well your garden variety penguin lays one egg a year. Since the spill our penguins have been laying six eggs every 15 minutes. [The hippies gasp.] Also, the eggs hatch in only 12 hours. [The hippies gasp again.] Also, the males are laying eggs.
",37,3,5
"8164","Doctor: This man is over-gasped.
",37,3,5
"8165","Waterfall Sr.: If the birds keep multiplying there'll soon be too many to count. [Behind him a video clip of a skinny penguin appears.] Before long the penguins will exhaust their food supply and starve to death.
",37,3,5
"8166","Leela: Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?
",37,3,5
"8167","Waterfall Sr.: Yes, I reckon it is our responsibility. And thankfully we have a plan.
",37,3,5
"8168","Leela: What is it? We'll do anything.
",37,3,5
"8169","Waterfall Sr.: Everyone, grab your guns. I declare penguin hunting season officially open.
",37,3,5
"8170","Leela: You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?
",37,3,5
"8171","Waterfall Sr.: Cold showers don't work on Antarctic creatures. Now surely you agree that a quick, semi-painless death is a damn sight better than weeks of starvation.
",37,3,5
"8172","Leela: Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them.
",37,3,5
"8173","Waterfall Sr.: This time the two are one and the same! Now are you with us or are you gonna let innocent penguins suffer?
",37,3,5
"8174","Leela: [crying] Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!
",37,3,5
"8175","Waterfall Sr.: That's a good old-fashioned gun. Simple point-and-click interface. Rifle check!
",37,3,5
"8176","Hunter #1: Oh, yeah!
",37,3,5
"8177","Hunter #2: Wee doggy!
",37,3,5
"8178","Leela: Hey, you're enjoying this.
",37,3,5
"8179","Waterfall Sr.: Look, nobody enjoys shooting penguins. But if you have to shoot penguins, well, you might as well enjoy it.
",37,3,5
"8180","Leela: I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism.
",37,3,5
"8181","Waterfall Sr.: Oh, really? How 'bout blowing up dams?
",37,3,5
"8182","Leela: Yeah ... that is fun.
",37,3,5
"8183","Waterfall Sr.: Let's conservate!
",37,3,5
"8184","Zoidberg: [shouting; from ship] It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!
",37,3,5
"8185","Leela: Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families. [She looks down the gunsight.] But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look. [She shakes as she starts to squeeze the trigger. A tear streams down her face. She shoots and the penguins squawk and run away.] [crying] Oh, no! What have I done? [She runs down the hillside. The penguins are gathered around a dead penguin. Leela falls to her knees and cries.] Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender? [Bender opens his eyes and resets to Human Mode. He loads the human language and brings up his task list. 1] Bend. 2] Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?
",37,3,5
"8186","Bender: Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo! [The penguins rub against him.] Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
",37,3,5
"8187","Leela: Aw! They love you!
",37,3,5
"8188","Bender: Well I don't love them. [A baby penguin looks up at him and cheeps.] Aw! [He regurgitates some food into it's mouth. Leela looks away.] I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!
",37,3,5
"8189","Penguins: [in penguin] Stand still. It's our only hope.
",37,3,5
"8190","Bender: [in penguin] That's puffin talk. Now follow me!
",37,3,5
"8191","Leela: Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.
",37,3,5
"8192","Hunter #2: Sorry.
",37,3,5
"8193","Waterfall Sr.: Why aren't you firing randomly into those birds, little lady? Don't you wanna help 'em?
",37,3,5
"8194","Leela: Not this way.
",37,3,5
"8195","Waterfall Sr.: What? Why you're not a tree-hugging kook at all!
",37,3,5
"8196","Leela: Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun.
",37,3,5
"8197","Waterfall Sr.: Leela, you may just be farming some free-range truth there. [Leela smiles.] On the other hand, we already made up 200 pounds of batter for penguin tempura. OK, boys, it's them or us!
",37,3,5
"8198","Leela: No!
",37,3,5
"8199","Waterfall Sr.: Hey! Where'd they--
",37,3,5

",37,3,5
"8202","Hunter #2: Ow!
",37,3,5
"8203","Bender: [in penguin] We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!

",37,3,5
"8205","Old Man Waterfall: [shouting] I'll avenge your death, son!
",37,3,5
"8206","Leela: They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
",37,3,5
"8207","Bender: Yep. It's like I taught 'em: If it ain't black and white, peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo. [He takes it off and puts it in his chest cabinet. The penguins turn away from Waterfall and move towards Leela and Bender.] Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!

"8212","Leela: It's Fry!
",37,3,5
"8213","Bender: Wiggles?
",37,3,5
"8214","Leela: Well, at least it'll help reduce their population.
",37,3,5
"8215","Bender: Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. [He laughs then slips over and slides down towards the open mouth of the whale. The cargo bay lift comes down and Fry grabs Bender's hand.] Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?

",38,3,6
"8240","Bender: Hmm. It should look like this. [He bends it into an L-shape.] But instead it looks like this.
",38,3,6
"8241","Fry: Who would do a thing like that?
",38,3,6
"8242","Bender: Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this.
",38,3,6
"8243","Zoidberg: Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.
",38,3,6
"8244","Hermes: I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge. [He draws along his straight-edge but halfway along the line starts to bend. He gasps.] Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!
",38,3,6
"8245","Amy: [crying] My javelin too! It's ruined. [She holds up her javelin which has been bent in eight places.] Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.
",38,3,6
"8246","Zoidberg: My slinky! [He runs over to the corner of the room and picks up a straightened slinky. He falls to his knees.] My cuddly, little pet slinky!
",38,3,6
"8247","Farnsworth: What's all the hubbub?
",38,3,6
"8248","Leela: My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
",38,3,6
"8249","Farnsworth: That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum.
",38,3,6
"8250","Bender: I'll get you fixed up. [He bends Farnsworth backwards so his face is pointing upwards. Farnsworth screams.] That's fine.
",38,3,6
"8251","Amy: Wait a minute. Bender, what did you just do to the Professor?
",38,3,6
"8252","Bender: I bent him.
",38,3,6
"8253","Amy: Aha!
",38,3,6
"8254","Hermes: Bender!
",38,3,6
"8255","Zoidberg: J'accuse!
",38,3,6
"8256","Bender: Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending.
",38,3,6
"8257","Hermes: I know how to settle this: We'll check last night's surveillance tapes.
",38,3,6
"8258","Fry: Huh?
",38,3,6
"8259","Amy: What tapes?
",38,3,6
"8260","Leela: Surveillance?
",38,3,6
"8261","Zoidberg: You've seen me naked?
",38,3,6
"8262","Hermes: Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
",38,3,6
"8263","Bender: See? Nothing. Told you, losers.
",38,3,6
"8264","Fry: Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
",38,3,6
"8265","Bender: I'm sleepwalking.
",38,3,6
"8266","Farnsworth: Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
",38,3,6
"8267","Fry: You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!
",38,3,6
"8268","Bender: This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built.
",38,3,6
"8269","Bender: [voice-over] I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
",38,3,6
"8270","Bender: Mama. [He reaches out and cries. The robotic arm opens a bottle of Olde Fortran and screws a baby bottle-top onto it and feeds Bender. The conveyor belt moves and carries Bender to a machine marked ""Bending School"". Another robot arm comes out of it and installs bending software into his head. A third one hands him a diploma and puts a hat on his head then it throws the hat in the air.] Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending.
",38,3,6
"8271","Amy: You remember your own birth?
",38,3,6
"8272","Bender: Sure. It was only four years ago.
",38,3,6
"8273","Fry: You're only four years old?
",38,3,6
"8274","Bender: Precocious little scamp, ain't I?
",38,3,6
"8275","Leela: Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.
",38,3,6
"8276","Farnsworth: Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company. [Bender hangs his head in shame.] Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.
",38,3,6
"8277","Robots: [chanting] No more bending, no more work. Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.
",38,3,6
"8278","Sal: [shouting] Nevers!
",38,3,6
"8279","Joey: Yo! The Mafia supports you. But don't tell no one. Spread the word.
",38,3,6
"8280","Donbot: As the duly-elected mobsters of this union, it's our duty to support the struggle of these proud, lazy slobs.
",38,3,6
"8281","Joey: Yeah, but what if management remains intragnizent?
",38,3,6
"8282","Donbot: From the context it is clear what you mean. In that case, Clamps may have a little surprise for them.
",38,3,6
"8283","Clamps: The clamps! [He clacks his clamps then turns to the Donbot.] [unsure] Right?
",38,3,6
"8284","Bender: Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender.
",38,3,6
"8285","Robot #1: Hang tough, brother. Management refused our demand to switch casual Friday to Monday.
",38,3,6
"8286","Bender: What?
",38,3,6
"8287","Robot #2: And now they're hiring scabs at ten-times the normal wage.
",38,3,6
"8288","Bender: Ten-times normal wage? [He rolls his sleeves up.] I'll give those jerks what for!
",38,3,6
"8289","Sal: Welcomes aboard, scab.
",38,3,6
"8290","Bender: Great to be here.
",38,3,6
"8291","Sal: Come on. I'll introduces you to your scab co-workers you'll be scabbing with. [He points to a bending unit.] This here's our scab foreman.
",38,3,6
"8292","Bender: Flexo?
",38,3,6
"8293","Flexo: Bender?
",38,3,6
"8294","Bender: Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity.
",38,3,6
"8295","Flexo: You bastard! They treated me like an animal and that's what I became! [He laughs.] Nah, you're alright. Good to see you, buddy!
",38,3,6
"8296","Sal: And here's another scab what also works here, Angle-ine.
",38,3,6
"8297","Bender: [sexfully] Hello.
",38,3,6
"8298","Sal: Hey, yous guyses wanna move that things?
",38,3,6
"8299","Bender: [more sexfully] Hello!
",38,3,6
"8300","Robots: [chanting] Give us a raise, you big fat jerk.
",38,3,6
"8301","Sal: [from outside] Nevers!
",38,3,6
"8302","Bender: Ow! [He strolls over to Angle-ine.] Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?
",38,3,6
"8303","Angle-ine: Making hangers. Guidance counsellor said I had a knack for it.
",38,3,6
"8304","Bender: That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?
",38,3,6
"8305","Angle-ine: What I always do. Jack squat.
",38,3,6
"8306","Bender: Me too. [He chuckles again.] Man, we have a lot in common, huh?
",38,3,6
"8307","Angle-ine: Well we are made of virtually identical components.
",38,3,6
"8308","Bender: [sexfully] Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
",38,3,6
"8309","Angle-ine: Hey, according to the scab handbook that's extremely inappropriate banter. [sexfully] And that's just the way I like it.
",38,3,6
"8310","Hermes: Haile H. Selassie!
",38,3,6
"8311","Zoidberg: There, little friend. Good as new.
",38,3,6
"8312","Farnsworth: What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops. [Behind him the crack addict exchanges money for crack with a dealer.] Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat.
",38,3,6
"8313","Fry: Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?
",38,3,6
"8314","Farnsworth: Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
",38,3,6
"8315","Fry: I wish! It's a nickel.
",38,3,6
"8316","Bender: Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
",38,3,6
"8317","Bender: I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
",38,3,6
"8318","Angle-ine: Well my legs are made of rubber. [She turns around.] And anyway, I am just as strong as you are, Mac.
",38,3,6
"8319","Bender: Oh, yeah? [A girder drops into his hands and he holds it out to Angle-ine.] Prove it. [She takes it and grunts as she tries to bend it. First she tries just with her hands then she puts it across her leg and tries and then she gives in and sighs. Bender stands behind her.] Here, let me help you.
",38,3,6
"8320","Farnsworth: My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.
",38,3,6
"8321","Fry: Alright!
",38,3,6
"8322","Farnsworth: Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
",38,3,6
"8323","Bender: Howdy, doodies. What's new?
",38,3,6
"8324","Farnsworth: I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--
",38,3,6
"8325","Bender: Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate.
",38,3,6
"8326","Amy: Let's get liquored up!
",38,3,6
"8327","Elzar: Hey, look at this crowd. You guys gotta try the pasta. It's got a real nice profit margin. Bam! So, special occasion tonight?
",38,3,6
"8328","Bender: Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?
",38,3,6
"8329","Elzar: Bam?
",38,3,6
"8330","Bender: I met the most dynamite ladybot.
",38,3,6
"8331","Elzar: Hey, that's terrific. To celebrate, I'm gonna stick seven copies of my latest cookbook on your bill.
",38,3,6
"8332","Bender: Bless you, sir.
",38,3,6
"8333","Farnsworth: So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours.
",38,3,6
"8334","Bender: I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast. [He stands and raises his glass.] To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot.
",38,3,6
"8335","Fry: She sure does.
",38,3,6
"8336","Bender: Flexo!
",38,3,6
"8337","Elzar: [shouting] Careful, that's a week old!
",38,3,6
"8338","Bender: I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass. [He walks over to their table.] You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine.
",38,3,6
"8339","Angle-ine: Bender, it's-it's not what you think.
",38,3,6
"8340","Bender: Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think.
",38,3,6
"8341","Angle-ine: Now, look, there is no reason to be upset. Flexo and I are divorced.
",38,3,6
"8342","Bender: Div-- Huh?
",38,3,6
"8343","Flexo: We're just havin' dinner 'cause we wanna stay friends.
",38,3,6
"8344","Bender: Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault.
",38,3,6
"8345","Steward: Excellent choice, sir.
",38,3,6
"8346","Bender: [muttering] That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this.
",38,3,6
"8347","Farnsworth: Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life.
",38,3,6
"8348","Bender: I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
",38,3,6
"8349","Leela: Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
",38,3,6
"8350","Fry: Yeah. Either that or be a man.
",38,3,6
"8351","Bender: OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie: I'll call Angle-ine while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself.
",38,3,6
"8352","Fry: That's thinkin' like a man.
",38,3,6
"8353","Bender: [disguised voice] Hello? This is Flexo.
",38,3,6
"8354","Bender: Now we'll see who loves whom.
",38,3,6
"8355","Bender: Hey, hot stuff.
",38,3,6
"8356","Angle-ine: Hey, Flexo. [She hugs him.] So since when do you go to bars on work nights? It's not like you at all.
",38,3,6
"8357","Bender: Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo: The fun-loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house.
",38,3,6
"8358","Bartender-bot: Two Fuzzy Navel's comin' up.
",38,3,6
"8359","Bender: I hope they can make change for a fortune.
",38,3,6
"8360","Joey: Yo. Get an eye-load of that filthy scab with the beard flashing his filthy scab money. It's an insult to you, boss.
",38,3,6
"8361","Donbot: Yeah. That cash oughta be slushin' my fund and kicksing my back.
",38,3,6
"8362","Clamps: I'm greasing up my whoozits!
",38,3,6
"8363","Donbot: Whoa, whoa, Clamps, not yet. Let's just keep an eye on him and see if he does it a couple more times.
",38,3,6
"8364","Bender: You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
",38,3,6
"8365","Angle-ine: Quit makin' with the googly eyes. You know that I'm in love with Bender.
",38,3,6
"8366","Bender: Bender? That walking wuss factory?
",38,3,6
"8367","Angle-ine: Well he may be a walking factory but believe me he is no wuss. Now, look, you and me are through. I told you that when I divorced you.
",38,3,6
"8368","Bender: But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?
",38,3,6
"8369","Angle-ine: You know I love dancing but you always hated it.
",38,3,6
"8370","Bender: In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you. [He puts his hand on hers. On the dancefloor he talks to the DJ-bot.] Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?
",38,3,6
"8371","Donbot: I had hoped that by the second time he flashed his cash my rage would have subsided. Sadly that has not happened.
",38,3,6
"8372","Angle-ine: You used to be so inflexible, Flexo. You have really loosened up!
",38,3,6
"8373","Bender: I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
",38,3,6
"8374","Angle-ine: Alright!
",38,3,6
"8375","Bender: C'mon now, what's new! [His goatee flies off his face and lands on a fat Fembot's behind. Bender carefully removes it.] Ew!
",38,3,6
"8376","Angle-ine: Flexo? What-What's going on?
",38,3,6
"8377","Bender: Um...
",38,3,6
"8378","Angle-ine: Flexo!
",38,3,6
"8379","Bender: So the moral of the story is: If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!
",38,3,6
"8380","Angle-ine: [laughing] You always were a kick in the teeth, man.
",38,3,6
"8381","Bender: Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts.
",38,3,6
"8382","Angle-ine: Flexo, Flexo, Flexo. I'm starting to remember why I fell for you in the first place.
",38,3,6
"8383","Bender: [thinking] So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure.
",38,3,6
"8384","Angle-ine: Well, it's late. I should get home to my trailer.
",38,3,6
"8385","Bender: I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need. [He takes a cigar out of his chest cabinet.] Tiparillo?
",38,3,6
"8386","Bender: Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible.
",38,3,6
"8387","Joey: He's flashin' his cash loaf again.
",38,3,6
"8388","Donbot: How many times is that? Two or three?
",38,3,6
"8389","Clamps: Three.
",38,3,6
"8390","Donbot: Alright. That's the necessary number of times. That scab's gonna have a little on-the-job accident.
",38,3,6
"8391","Joey: With all due respect, Donbot, I don't think we should rely on an accident happening. Let's kill him ourselves.
",38,3,6
"8392","'Angle-ine: Well, goodnight. I-I had a great time.
",38,3,6
"8393","Bender: How 'bout a lift? To your place.
",38,3,6
"8394","Angle-ine: What?
",38,3,6
"8395","Bender: Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by ""me"" I mean Flexo.
",38,3,6
"8396","'Angle-ine: Hey, look, I had fun, but--
",38,3,6
"8397","Bender: But?
",38,3,6
"8398","'Angle-ine: But--
",38,3,6
"8399","Bender: But?
",38,3,6
"8400","Angle-ine: [gasping] But... [They kiss. They pull their heads away and Bender sees his goatee has stuck to her face. She pulls it off.] Huh? Bender! You tricked me.
",38,3,6
"8401","Bender: That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him.
",38,3,6
"8402","Angle-ine: Well maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you're pretending to be.
",38,3,6
"8403","Bender: Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: Kill Flexo. [He punches his knuckles together.] Ow!
",38,3,6
"8404","Angle-ine: [screaming] Nooo!
",38,3,6
"8405","Flexo: Thanks, I appreciate that. [He laughs.] Nah, I'm joshing you. That was quite annoying.
",38,3,6
"8406","Bender: You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
",38,3,6
"8407","Flexo: What?
",38,3,6
"8408","Clamps: Alright, boss, give the word and I'll drop this unbendable girder. Clamp, clamp, ka-bamp!
",38,3,6
"8409","Donbot: Remember, only kill the one with the beard. That other filthy scab we got nothing against.
",38,3,6
"8410","Flexo: That's low!
",38,3,6
"8411","Angle-ine: Please stop! I'm not worth it!
",38,3,6
"8412","Bender: Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back.
",38,3,6
"8413","Donbot: [from control room] OK, Clamps. Now!
",38,3,6
"8414","Clamps: Ooh, that's gotta clamp!
",38,3,6
"8415","Angle-ine: Flexo? Are you OK?
",38,3,6
"8416","Flexo: Yeah, never better. [He coughs up oil.] Nah, I'm yankin' your chain, I'm dying.
",38,3,6
"8417","Angle-ine: You can't die. Tonight Bender showed me that I love you.
",38,3,6
"8418","Bender: But, I love you.
",38,3,6
"8419","Angle-ine: I know and I care for you too. But I could never love anyone as much as you made me realise I love Flexo.
",38,3,6
"8420","Bender: But ... but... [He sighs.] I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what.
",38,3,6
"8421","Angle-ine: What, what are you saying?
",38,3,6
"8422","Bender: I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
",38,3,6
"8423","Angle-ine: You can't bend that girder. It's unbendable!
",38,3,6
"8424","Bender: Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option.
",38,3,6
"8425","Flexo: Thanks, buddy. Another year under that and I'd have been a goner.
",38,3,6
"8426","Angle-ine: I'll always remember this, Bender.
",38,3,6
"8427","Bender: [crying] Me too. Me too. [talking] Jerk.
",38,3,6
"8428","Leela: So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system.
",38,3,6
"8429","Bender: Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time.
",38,3,6
"8430","Farnsworth: Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
",38,3,6
"8431","Fry: Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude.
",38,3,6
"8432","Amy: I'll say.
",38,3,6
"8433","Zoidberg: Believe it.
",38,3,6
"8434","Farnsworth: Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote:
(singing) We all need a new angle on life,
You gotta bend away all your trouble and your strife,
",38,3,6
"8435","Leela: Bender, you've gotta help us.
",38,3,6
"8436","Bender: I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
",38,3,6
"8437","Farnsworth: [singing] You gotta dangle,
Have a new angle,
Wangle a new dangle on life,
",38,3,6
"8438","Amy: No, Bender! The other way.
",38,3,6
"8439","Bender: I like him better this way.
",38,3,6
"8440","Farnsworth: I'm sad now.
",38,3,6
"8441","Leela: Eh, it's fine.
",38,3,6
"8442","Amy: Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?
",39,3,7
"8443","Leela: He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through. [She puts Nibbler down and takes a whole joint out of the bag.] Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham. [Nibbler doesn't move.] Roll over. Roll over for the ham. [Nibbler chirps and licks his leg and arm.] You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?
",39,3,7
"8444","Farnsworth: Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
",39,3,7

",39,3,7
"8446","Zoidberg: ""Dog food"", you say?
",39,3,7

",39,3,7
"8448","Leela: The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad. [The Hypno-Toad is a toad, almost the size of the sheep. It stares at them and it's eyes oscillate and buzz. The sheep walk in single file into the pen and one closes the gate behind it. The judges confer and the Hypno-Toad turns around and hypnotises them. They stare at it, open-mouthed and raise ""10"" cards. The crowd cheers. Leela stands at the side of the ring and puts Nibbler into it.] Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!

"8449","Amy: Come on, Nibbler!
",39,3,7
"8450","Bender: [to judge] Ma'am, I have a late entry: My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg.
",39,3,7
"8451","Bender: Faster! Faster.
",39,3,7
"8452","Zoidberg: Ow!
",39,3,7
"8453","Bender: Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
",39,3,7
"8454","Bender: Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!
",39,3,7
"8455","Bender: I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
",39,3,7
"8456","Fry: I love these things!
",39,3,7
"8457","Leela: Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. [He doesn't.] He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!
",39,3,7
"8458","Judge #1: Third prize, a party-sized keg of guinea pigs, goes to Dave Spiegel and his owner, Fluffers. [A human-sized cat strokes a cat-sized man. The crowd cheers and Fluffers stands on the podium.] Second prize, this lovely afghan made from an Afghan, goes to Bender and his wooping terrier.
",39,3,7
"8459","Bender: Second place? [He pulls Zoidberg's choke chain.] That's a fancy word for losing. [He whips Zoidberg as he speaks.] You didn't stick your landing!
",39,3,7
"8460","Zoidberg: Forgive me, my friend.
",39,3,7
"8461","Bender: Never!
",39,3,7
"8462","Judge #1: And before we announce the winner we have a special award for a first-time contestant: Ms. Leela and her mystery pet, Nibbler!
",39,3,7
"8463","Leela: Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
",39,3,7
"8464","Judge #1: That's just the kind of eloquence you'd expect from the owner of Dumbest Pet in Show. [He puts a conical hat on Nibbler with ""Dumb"" written down the middle of it. Everyone laughs.] And the grand prize winner ... [He looks at his notes and adjusts his glasses.] [monotonous] ... the Hypno-Toad. [The Hypno-Toad sits on the podium hypnotising the judge. The Hypno-Toad turns to the crowd and they clap in unison.] All glory to the Hypno-Toad.
",39,3,7
"8465","Leela: Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
",39,3,7
"8466","Fry: Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them.
",39,3,7
"8467","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed.
",39,3,7
"8468","Leela: Why is that good news?
",39,3,7
"8469","Farnsworth: They paid in advance.
",39,3,7
"8470","Bender: Excuse me.
",39,3,7
"8471","Hermes: This is mighty strange. [He presses a remote control, the lights dim and a holographic display comes up on the table showing a series of planets.] First, the civilisation of Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12.
",39,3,7
"8472","Fry: [pointing] Looks like this planet is next in line.
",39,3,7
"8473","Leela: That's Earth. [Fry stares blankly.] The planet we live on.
",39,3,7
"8474","Fry: I'd hate to be those guys.
",39,3,7
"8475","Hermes: What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word ""food"".
",39,3,7
"8476","Zoidberg: [twitching] What, now?
",39,3,7
"8477","Leela: [shouting] No! Nibbler, come back!
",39,3,7
"8478","Leela: Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself. [She sees a blue glow coming from a dumpster at the end of the alley.] Nibbler? [She walks closer to it.] Nibbler, you're scaring me. [The lid flips open and one of the brains comes out. Leela screams. She runs away and it chases her. Two more join it and she rolls under a fence. The brains bump into it. She sees Nibbler at the other end of the alley. He is dressed in a blue flight suit and is pulling a tiny spaceship out of a little shed. She gasps.] Nibbler? [He looks at her and climbs into the spaceship. There is a small hole in the roof for his third eye to go into.] Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me? [Nibbler takes off and waves goodbye. The brains fly over the fence and Leela gasps.] [shouting] Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here. [Nibbler lands. Leela hurries into the ship and it blasts off again, knocking the brains out of the way. The ship flies around the Planet Express building and up into space.] Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?
",39,3,7
"8479","Fry: Leela back yet?
",39,3,7
"8480","Bender: Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!
",39,3,7
"8481","Fry: You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
",39,3,7
"8482","Bender: Sure ... right. Robot! [He looks at his arms.] Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky.
",39,3,7
"8483","Fry: Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal.
",39,3,7
"8484","Bender: Am I a robot?
",39,3,7
"8485","Fry: Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.
",39,3,7
"8486","Bender: Fry! [He gasps.] My skin!

"8487","Farnsworth: Ow. Ow. Ow. [Enter Fry.] I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
",39,3,7
"8488","Fry: Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?
",39,3,7
"8489","Zoidberg: Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! [He jumps around.] Zoidy want go outside!
",39,3,7
"8490","Fry: [angry] I just let you back in!
",39,3,7
"8491","Leela: This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk. [Nibbler chatters.] Wait! I understood that! [He chatters again.] You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain. [He says something else.] You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid? [He says something else.] Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe? [Nibbler says something that sounds like ""yes"".] So, how did the universe begin? [Nibbler tells her.] Then the meaning of existence-- [Nibbler acknowledges.] So every religion is wrong!

"8492","Linda: [on TV] You fell! [She turns to the camera and waves.] Hi! Today some bad things happened. One bad thing was a train got crashed in New Jersey. Wanna see?

"8497","Morbo: [waving; on TV] Hello, little man. I will destroy you!

",39,3,7
"8507","Nibbler: Thank you. I bear many receipts for reimbursement.
",39,3,7

",39,3,7
"8509","Leela: I'm not afraid.
",39,3,7
"8510","Fiona: Uh, good. Good.
",39,3,7
"8511","Leela: So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence.
",39,3,7
"8512","Nibbler: That name is for your sake. In the time it would take to pronounce one letter of my true name, a trillion cosmoses would flair into existence and sink into eternal night.
",39,3,7
"8513","Leela: Oh, you're all so cute!
",39,3,7
"8514","Ken: No, we're not. [He pulls his hood off.] We Nibblonians are an ancient and powerful race. Behold. [A hologram appears above his head and changes as he narrates.] When the universe was forged in the crucible of the Big Bang, our mighty race was already 17 years old.
",39,3,7
"8515","Leela: Aww!
",39,3,7
"8516","Ken: For the first millisecond of time, things were OK. But then there arose a terrible enemy: The Brain Spawn. [The Nibblonians chatter.] Ever since, we have waged unceasing war against these dreadful--
",39,3,7
"8517","Nibblonian Chef: Lunch is ready.
",39,3,7
"8518","Ken: Then let the feast of a thousand hams begin.
",39,3,7
"8519","Leela: So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?
",39,3,7
"8520","Nibbler: The Brain Spawn hate all consciousness. The thoughts of others screech at them like the forced laughs of a billion art house movie patrons.
",39,3,7
"8521","Ken: Thus, they travel from world to world making everyone stupid in order to wipe out all thought in the universe.
",39,3,7
"8522","Leela: Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
",39,3,7
"8523","Fiona: And even we are powerless to stop them, fearsome though we are.
",39,3,7
"8524","Nibbler: There is but one being who can resist them. A child of destiny whose bizarre brain wave pattern makes him immune to the Brain Spawn attack. [The hologram changes to Fry sitting in the Planet Express lounge looking at the soles of his feet.] He is the hope of the universe. [Leela gasps.] The fate of your world, perhaps all worlds, rests in his special mind.
",39,3,7
"8525","Leela: Now, when you say ""special""...
",39,3,7
"8526","Fry: Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!
",39,3,7
"8527","Ken: [on radio] Nibblonian fleet holding at perimeter of moron zone, formerly known as ""Earth"".
",39,3,7
"8528","Leela: Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
",39,3,7
"8529","Fiona: The Brain Spawn suppress intelligence by attacking the delta brain wave. Every animal and robot in the universe generates this wave, as do certain trees.
",39,3,7
"8530","Nibbler: Fry, however, does not.
",39,3,7
"8531","Fiona: Somehow he has cobbled together a random assortment of other brain waves into a working mind.
",39,3,7
"8532","Leela: Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
",39,3,7
"8533","Nibbler: Yes, like your prom dress.
",39,3,7
"8534","Ken: The Brain Spawn are commanded by a giant, evil brain with a gooey centre of pure hate.
",39,3,7
"8535","Fiona: Only Fry, with his superior, yet inferior mind, can approach him. You must tell him to disable it. We will do the rest.
",39,3,7
"8536","Leela: You can count on me.
",39,3,7
"8537","Fiona: No, we can't. Once on Earth, you will be too stupid to remember the message.
",39,3,7
"8538","Nibbler: That's why we wrote it down for you.
",39,3,7
"8539","Ken: We've also prepared a bag lunch and some mittens.
",39,3,7
"8540","Fry: Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents. [He takes a head in a jar out of the box.] This was our first president, George Washington. [The staff stare blankly. Amy twitches and Farnsworth scratches his head.] Let's review. Who was our first president?
",39,3,7
"8541","Amy: Um.
",39,3,7
"8542","Bender: A pickle jar?
",39,3,7
"8543","Washington: Thomas Jefferson?

",39,3,7
"8545","Leela: I ... have to tell ... must ... important ... something--
",39,3,7
"8546","Fry: Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute.
",39,3,7
"8547","Leela: This! You for this!
",39,3,7
"8548","Fry: Thanks!
",39,3,7
"8549","Leela: No! [She runs over to it and puts her hand in the flame.] Ow! Fire hot.
",39,3,7
"8550","Farnsworth: The professy will help! [He puts his hand in and his lab coat catches fire. He screams.] Fire indeed hot!

",39,3,7
"8555","Fry: Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
",39,3,7
"8556","Leela: [shrugging] I 'unno!
",39,3,7
"8557","Fry: Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? [He gasps.] The libary!
",39,3,7
"8558","Big Brain: Pathetic human race. Arranging their knowledge by category just made it easier to absorb. Dewey, you fool, your decimal system has played right into my hands! [It laughs. Fry pushes the door wide open and he and Leela run in. Before the Big Brain can react, Fry has closed the door and Leela has tipped a bookshelf over so it blocks the door. It gasps.] What do you want?
",39,3,7
"8559","Fry: I'm here to kick your ass.
",39,3,7
"8560","Big Brain: Wishful thinking. We have long since evolved beyond the need for asses. [It flies up towards the ceiling and envelopes Fry's head in a blue glow.] Odd. My stupefaction field is having no effect on your ability to think.
",39,3,7
"8561","Fry: That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing! [He throws a book at the brain. It bounces of it harmlessly.] OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think! [He rubs his temple.] Thinking ... thinking...
",39,3,7
"8562","Big Brain: Oh! Stop that!
",39,3,7
"8563","Fry: Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that. [The Brain groans again.] Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.
",39,3,7
"8564","Leela: Duh...
",39,3,7
"8565","Fry: Seriously, I can't think of anything. [The Brain laughs, it's strength returning. Fry picks up some books.] Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!
",39,3,7
"8566","Big Brain: No! It's unbearable!
",39,3,7
"8567","Fiona: The brains are weakening. [She presses an intercom button.] Nibblonians to Nibble stations. Prepare cuddle bug for deployment in 40 nibblets.
",39,3,7
"8568","Nibbler: Sometimes I fear we are cute.
",39,3,7
"8569","Fiona: Oh, niggle-snoosh!
",39,3,7
"8570","Fry: Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
",39,3,7
"8571","Big Brain: You have not won yet. [It's purple glow returns.] Each book in this room is a gateway to a mental realm and I shall take you there and imprison you forever.

"8639","Tour Guide: Then you'll wanna get a close look at his luxurious Bel-Air home.
",40,3,8
"8640","Bender: Yes, I will.
",40,3,8
"8641","Calculon: Are you my new hot water heater?
",40,3,8
"8642","Bender: No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?
",40,3,8
"8643","Calculon: Absolutely not.
",40,3,8
"8644","Bender: Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?
",40,3,8
"8645","Calculon: Look, I'm programmed to be very busy. Unless you can heat water to 212 degrees, I'm not interested. [He closes the door and Bender immediately rings the bell. Calculon opens the door again.] Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line? I said I don't need a bender.
",40,3,8
"8646","Bender: Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
",40,3,8
"8647","Calculon: Nice work, Boiler.
",40,3,8
"8648","Bender: Thanks. And call me Bender.
",40,3,8
"8649","Zoidberg: That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten.
",40,3,8
"8650","Zoidberg: Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!
",40,3,8
"8651","Zoid: Rich nephew, come over here and give your uncle a nice, big meal. [They hug and sit down.] So, here we are: A still-famous film comedian.
",40,3,8
"8652","Zoidberg: And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients.
",40,3,8
"8653","Zoid: Eating real food in a restaurant, as we both often do. So, you want to be a comedian, is it?
",40,3,8
"8654","Zoidberg: It's my lifelong dream.
",40,3,8
"8655","Zoid: [shouting] Well that dream dies now. [He bangs his claw on the table.] You're unfunny and untalented. That's why you're perfect for drama.
",40,3,8
"8656","Zoidberg: Hmm. Serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
",40,3,8
"8657","Zoid: I'm putting together a big drama picture right now, as we speak. The script is dynamite. I know because I wrote it myself. And with me directing and starring, I'll be back on top after 50 miserable years-- [Zoidberg gives him a curious look.] Uh, of fame.
",40,3,8
"8658","Zoidberg: Ah, fame. Where do I come in?
",40,3,8
"8659","Zoid: This fame film has a juicy part for you, if you completely finance it with your doctor money. So, are you in?
",40,3,8
"8660","Zoidberg: Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?
",40,3,8
"8661","Zoid: Oh, not much, not much, [quietly and quickly] A million dollars. [Zoidberg spits water out off every valve in his head.] [normal] Then it's settled. Another blockbuster Hollywood deal.
",40,3,8
"8662","Waiter: What can I get you gentlemen?
",40,3,8
"8663","Zoidberg: Is bread free?
",40,3,8
"8664","Waiter: Yeah.
",40,3,8
"8665","Zoidberg: We'll split an order.
",40,3,8
"8666","Bender: What's with Monstro?
",40,3,8
"8667","Fry: He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
",40,3,8
"8668","Zoidberg: [crying] I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
",40,3,8
"8669","Bender: [proud] Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz.
",40,3,8
"8670","Fry: Since when have you been in the biz?
",40,3,8
"8671","Bender: Long enough, little man. Long enough.
",40,3,8
"8672","Bender: Calculon, as your hot water heater ... [Calculon uses Bender as a hot water caddy and pours water into a mug with a tea bag in it.] ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star.
",40,3,8
"8673","Calculon: Of course. Tell me about the project.
",40,3,8
"8674","Zoidberg: It's a movie.
",40,3,8
"8675","Calculon: Interesting. Tell me more.
",40,3,8
"8676","Bender: Get this: For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star.
",40,3,8
"8677","Calculon: And?
",40,3,8
"8678","Bender: And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar.
",40,3,8
"8679","Calculon: An Oscar, you say? That would get me out of this festering rat's nest called ""television"" once and for all. Let me see the script. [Zoidberg hands it to him and he speed-reads it.] No. No, I don't like the font. [He looks at the cover.] Wait! Harold Zoid? Was this written by the Harold Zoid?
",40,3,8
"8680","Zoidberg: Written and Xeroxed.
",40,3,8
"8681","Calculon: Good heavens! A chance to work with the legendary Harold Zoid. He's one of my great idols. And-And you say you can guarantee me the Oscar?
",40,3,8
"8682","Bender: I can guarantee anything you want.
",40,3,8
"8683","Calculon: Then I'll do it!
",40,3,8
"8684","Zoidberg: Hooray!
",40,3,8
"8685","Bender: Here's your chequebook.
",40,3,8
"8686","Calculon: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our director, the legendary Harold Zoid!
",40,3,8
"8687","Zoid: Thank you. A more classic movie plot there isn't: A son who does not want to follow in his father's business. And that business is being President of Earth, no less. The son, as it happens, is Vice President.
",40,3,8
"8688","Bender: [to Calculon] That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink.
",40,3,8
"8689","Zoidberg: Bender, you said ""wink, wink"" out loud.
",40,3,8
"8690","Bender: No, I didn't. Raise middle finger.
",40,3,8
"8691","Zoid: Now remember, and I can't stress this enough, this is a talkie, so I want the full gamut of emotions from every actor in every scene.
",40,3,8
"8692","Zoidberg: The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one.
",40,3,8
"8693","Zoid: And, action!
",40,3,8
"8694","Calculon: Take back your gilded pen, Father. Signing bills into law was always your dream, not mine.
",40,3,8
"8695","Zoid: Cut! Cut! Cut it! [He spits.] I said this is a talkie, damnit! You've got to emote more! And you extras, wave your arms and make faces. What is this, a morgue?
",40,3,8
"8696","Zoidberg: The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95.
",40,3,8
"8697","Zoid: Action. And I mean circus-grade action.
",40,3,8
"8698","Calculon: [melodramatically] Sir, I call upon you not as a President but as a father.
",40,3,8
"8699","Zoid: Cut, cut, cut it! [He turns to Calculon.] Would you show a little emotion? [He turns to the extras.] People, people, please. Just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the background. [The extras nod.] Throw a pie or two, for God's sake.
",40,3,8
"8700","Calculon: [screaming] Nooo!
",40,3,8
"8701","Zoid: Cut, cut it! Eck! Look, look, it's alright, kid. We'll, uh, we'll get it in editing. Alright, that's a wrap, everybody. I'm gonna see you all at the premiere which, by the way, when is?
",40,3,8
"8702","Zoidberg: Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday.
",40,3,8
"8703","Bender: Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel.
",40,3,8
"8704","Calculon: I just pray they like me half as much as I do.
",40,3,8
"8705","Calculon: [in movie] I agreed to be your Vice President but I never agreed to be your son. [He splashes water in Zoid's face and leaves. Zoidberg, wearing a white naval uniform, opens the door for him and salutes.] Thank you, Lieutenant Smith.
",40,3,8
"8706","Zoidberg: [in movie] Good morning, Mr. Vice President!
",40,3,8
"8707","Fry: Leela, we're missing the premiere. [Leela wears a dress and hair sticks.] My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks.
",40,3,8
"8708","Leela: No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead.
",40,3,8
"8709","Calculon: [in movie] Father, I've asked you to join me on the White House roof so we could have a heart-to-heart talk. I will never follow in your footsteps. Here is my resignation as Vice President.
",40,3,8
"8710","Zoid: [in movie] No! My son will not shame me like this. I would sooner die, I would!
",40,3,8
"8711","Calculon: [in movie] Father! The ledge!
",40,3,8
"8712","Zoid: [in movie] Oy!
",40,3,8
"8713","Calculon: [in movie] Oh!
",40,3,8
"8714","Zoidberg: [in movie] The President is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President!
",40,3,8
"8715","Calculon: [screaming; in movie] Nooo!
",40,3,8
"8716","Bender: [cheering] Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
",40,3,8
"8717","Calculon: Everyone walked out. They hated it. I've seen plagues that had better opening nights than this. You said that Oscar was practically on my mantel.
",40,3,8
"8718","Bender: Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically"".
",40,3,8
"8719","Calculon: You listen to me. I'm out a million bucks here! You get me that Oscar or you're dead! You and these snivelling lobsters! Dead. You hear me? Dead!
",40,3,8
"8720","Zoid: Oy, now he emotes!
",40,3,8
"8721","Zoidberg: Let's just hope Calculon breaks our legs; they'll grow back.
",40,3,8
"8722","Zoid: He's gonna kill us, you klutzel! Who told that under-acting stiff he was going to get an Oscar?
",40,3,8
"8723","Bender: Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie.
",40,3,8
"8724","Zoid: He paid? [He turns to Zoidberg.] I though you paid, with your big-shot doctor money.
",40,3,8
"8725","Zoidberg: [crying] I lied.
",40,3,8
"8726","Zoid: OK, enough with the blubbering, already. The way I directed the hell out of him, he may still very well get the nomination.
",40,3,8
"8727","Bender: Wink.
",40,3,8
"8728","Calculon: 400 categories and not a single nomination for me.
",40,3,8
"8729","Zoidberg: But you won this Golden Globe!
",40,3,8
"8730","Calculon: Piffle! That's the Emmy of movie awards! [He throws it towards Bender. He dodges it and it hits an All My Circuits: The Movie poster.] I told you I want an Oscar.
",40,3,8
"8731","Bender: Then maybe you should act better.
",40,3,8
"8732","Calculon: The Oscar isn't about acting. It's about earning the respect and admiration of the creative community.
",40,3,8
"8733","Zoid: How 'bout we rig the awards?
",40,3,8
"8734","Calculon: That's fine too.
",40,3,8
"8735","Leela: It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it.
",40,3,8
"8736","Fry: Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights. [He looks out of the window and a skeleton floats past.] Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!
",40,3,8
"8737","Zoidberg: This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
",40,3,8
"8738","Zoid: No, I'm not. I'm an even bigger liar than you. My career went down the tubes the day they invented smell-a-vision.
",40,3,8
"8739","Bender: Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
",40,3,8
"8740","Zoid: Oy. All I wanted was for people to think of me one last time before I die.
",40,3,8
"8741","Zoidberg: What are you talking about, Uncle? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!
",40,3,8
"8742","Zoid: As a pathetic has-been, they remember me. As a forgotten relic, they remember me. Bah! It's better to die now.
",40,3,8
"8743","Zoidberg: No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
",40,3,8
"8744","Rivers: Hi, I'm Joan Rivers' head. I tell you, I've had so many face-lifts, they finally lifted it right off my body! It's true, it's true! Oh, oh, oh! Here comes Jack Nicholson's DNA reconstituted in a gorilla body.
",40,3,8
"8745","Bender: Catering.
",40,3,8
"8746","Rivers: Oh, and here's washed-up actor, whatshisname, Harold Zoid. Are you presenting one of those tacky honorary awards, or just getting one?
",40,3,8
"8747","Zoid: I'm a seat-filler, Joan's head. My only marketable skill is to occupy space.
",40,3,8
"8748","Calculon: You know, the second I don't win that award, you're cat food. Right, Boxy?
",40,3,8
"8749","Announcer: And now, the host of the 1074th Academy Awards, Billy Crystal.
",40,3,8
"8750","Crystal: Now I know how a Pez dispenser feels. [The audience laughs. Jack Nicholson bangs his chest.] Oh, you like that one, Jack? [He impersonates a gorilla. The Oscar statue picks up Crystal's jar and puts it on a podium.] Alright, we're already one hour behind. [Nicholson grunts.] Our first award tonight: Best Cinematography in a Non-Visible Spectrum.
",40,3,8
"8751","Fry: It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
",40,3,8
"8752","Leela: Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?
",40,3,8
"8753","Fry: What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
",40,3,8
"8754","Leela: It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life. [She gasps.] The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!
",40,3,8
"8755","Fry: Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe.
",40,3,8
"8756","Zoidberg: What category are they on?
",40,3,8
"8757","Bender: They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
",40,3,8
"8758","Zoidberg: That just leaves Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time.
",40,3,8
"8759","Crystal: And the nominees for Best Soft-Drink Product Placement are:
",40,3,8
"8760","Slurm Machine: Star Trek: The Pepsi Generation, They Call Me Mr. Pibb and Snow White and the 7 Ups.
",40,3,8
"8761","Bender: And now to present the award for Best Actor ... [Zoidberg walks onto the stage.] ... a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three ... [The audience murmur.] ... Dr. Zoidberg.
",40,3,8
"8762","Calculon: [quietly] OK, Boxy, keep your prong on the trigger.
",40,3,8
"8763","Zoidberg: And the nominees for Best Actor are: Sir Lawrence-- [He makes a weird noise.] ... in The Merchant of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy, Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three.
",40,3,8
"8764","Man #1: Uh-oh, he read the wrong name.
",40,3,8
"8765","Man #2: [whispering] Shh, just play along, like they did for Marisa Tomei.
",40,3,8
"8766","Zoid: Hooray, I won't be murdered. I'll live another day. Another day of ... pathetic, forgotten misery.
",40,3,8
"8767","Zoidberg: And the winner is... [Calculon starts to stand up.] And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!
",40,3,8
"8768","Zoid: Thank you. Thank you so much! You know, through all my ups and downs, I always thought the most important thing in life was to win an Oscar. But tonight I realise what's really important is to win two Oscars. Ha! Ha! I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What really matters in life is that people care about you, whether it's a whole crowd ... [The audience is unenthusiastic.] ... or just one die-hard fan.
",40,3,8
"8769","Zoid: Thank you, nephew. [He kisses him.] Now I can die happy. 10 seconds from now, when Calculon kills us.
",40,3,8
"8770","Calculon: Harold Zoid!
",40,3,8
"8771","Bender: Hit the deck!
",40,3,8
"8772","Calculon: Where's that Oscar?
",40,3,8
"8773","Zoid: Here, enjoy. What are you getting upset? It's slightly less fraudulent for you to have it.
",40,3,8
"8774","Calculon: Yes. Yes, it's a real beauty. Someday I hope to win one of my own.
",40,3,8
"8775","Bender: Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?
",40,3,8
"8776","Calculon: Nay. I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
",40,3,8
"8777","Zoidberg: Earthquake!
",40,3,8
"8778","Bender: Hit the deck!
",40,3,8
"8779","Zoid: Let the earth quake, I've got somebody's Oscar!
",40,3,8
"8780","Fry: We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
",40,3,8
"8781","Doorman: I'm sorry, sir, this is a private-- Oh, pardon me, I see you're with Mr. Stallone.
",40,3,8
"8782","Morbo: So I gave the cookies you made to Fawn and the kids and they couldn't believe it -- they were delicious. But, I digress. [He turns to the camera.] [shouting] Tremble, puny earthlings! One day my race will destroy you all!

"8783","Leela: Could one of you guys get that?
",41,3,9
"8784","Leela: It's a doorbell baby! [She crouches down to the bundle of blankets in the basket. Fry and Bender appears behind her.] Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so--
",41,3,9

",41,3,9
"8786","Leela: Bender, stop! It's a baby!
",41,3,9
"8787","Bender: [stamping] A baby what? [Leela kicks him in the head and he falls over.] Ow!
",41,3,9
"8788","Leela: Oh, it's just a card. From the orphanarium I grew up in.
",41,3,9
"8789","Card: Leela, you're invited to a reunion at Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. [The voice changes to an adult woman's voice.] Please stand clear of self-destructing basket.
",41,3,9
"8790","Bender: A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?
",41,3,9
"8791","Leela: No way, Jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me.

",41,3,9
"8795","Kirk: My eyes may not work, but at least I got two of them!
",41,3,9
"8796","Fry: Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'Oeuvres.
",41,3,9
"8797","Leela: Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces.
",41,3,9
"8798","Bender: Set a course for adventure!
",41,3,9
"8799","Fry: Ew!
",41,3,9
"8800","Bender: What a dump!
",41,3,9
"8801","Leela: Just like old times. Gosh! The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then. [An old man approaches her from behind. He is dressed in a grey suit and is wearing a grade 135 badge. He clears his throat and Leela turns around.] Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
",41,3,9
"8802","Vogel: Leela! You're worthless and no one will ever love you!

",41,3,9
"8808","Fry: I don't see you anywhere.

"8841","Vogel: Plus, the government will help out with a small stipend of $100 a week.
",41,3,9
"8842","Bender: $100 a week?
",41,3,9
"8843","Adlai: I'm so sorry I teased you back then. Let me make it up to you. I can fix it so no one ever makes fun of you again.
",41,3,9
"8844","Leela: You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
",41,3,9
"8845","Adlai: No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. I can build you a paraffin eye and graft it on with skin from your foot. It won't be able to see but you'll look like a perfectly normal two-eyed person.
",41,3,9
"8846","Leela: Me? Perfectly normal?
",41,3,9
"8847","Bender: Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.
",41,3,9
"8848","Fry: Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?
",41,3,9
"8849","Bender: No. It's called ""parenting"". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect.
",41,3,9
"8850","Boy: Our daddy's a giant toy!
",41,3,9
"8851","Farnsworth: Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
",41,3,9
"8852","Amy: I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here ... [She points to her cheek.] ... and here.
",41,3,9
"8853","Fry: You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
",41,3,9
"8854","Leela: Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal.
",41,3,9
"8855","Fry: But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think.
",41,3,9
"8856","Leela: You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think! [She stands up.] I'm getting the surgery.
",41,3,9
"8857","Farnsworth: That a girl!
",41,3,9
"8858","Amy: Right on!
",41,3,9
"8859","Zoidberg: Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies.
",41,3,9
"8860","Farnsworth: That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard, you imbecile!
",41,3,9
"8861","Adlai: Now we'll find out if the operation was a success. Hold on to your hats. [He starts to pull the bandages off. The staff peer at her closer. Adlai pulls off the bandages and reveals a smiling, two-eyed, blonde woman. The staff gasp.] Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient. [They move to another bed and Adlai pulls off the real Leela's bandages. The others gasp at Leela's new face. The pupil in her left eye falls out.] Oops.
",41,3,9
"8862","Amy: Leela, those eyes look so great on you.
",41,3,9
"8863","Fry: Bah! I think she looked fine before.
",41,3,9
"8864","Farnsworth: No.
",41,3,9
"8865","Zoidberg: No.
",41,3,9
"8866","Amy: Uh-uh.
",41,3,9
"8867","Hermes: Wrong.
",41,3,9
"8868","Leela: Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet.
",41,3,9
"8869","Adlai: You'll get it. Personally, I try not to blink too much because it seems flashy. But when I do, I enjoy it.
",41,3,9
"8870","Leela: I did it! I blunk!
",41,3,9
"8871","Hermes: And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
",41,3,9
"8872","Leela: Hooray!
",41,3,9
"8873","Walt: Ow!
",41,3,9
"8874","Igner: Ow!
",41,3,9
"8875","Larry: Ow!
",41,3,9
"8876","Leela: I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
",41,3,9
"8877","Bender: Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.
",41,3,9
"8878","Kids: [chanting] Hello, jerkbags!
",41,3,9
"8879","Amy: Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?
",41,3,9
"8880","Bender: Kids have names?
",41,3,9
"8881","Nina: My name's Nina, and his name's Albert--
",41,3,9
"8882","Bender: And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.! [He takes a piece of paper out of his chest cabinet.] Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!
",41,3,9
"8883","Sally: Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
",41,3,9
"8884","Bender: What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food! [The kids look sad.] Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food.
",41,3,9
"8885","Albert: Can we have Bender burgers again?
",41,3,9
"8886","Bender: No. The cat shelter's on to me!
",41,3,9
"8887","Adlai: Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor getting one of my Hawai'ian shirts toned down, so I thought I'd drop in for your follow-up exam.
",41,3,9
"8888","Leela: Oh. That's so handsome of you.
",41,3,9
"8889","Adlai: Just follow the light with your eyes. [He draws the light back and forth in front of her but only the real eye follows it.] Perfect! You know, a guy could fall head-over-heels for a gal like you. [Fry walks behind him and frowns.] As for me, I'm somewhat interested myself.
",41,3,9
"8890","Leela: What are you saying?
",41,3,9
"8891","Adlai: I've never been good with words, which is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. Will you go out with me this Sunday?
",41,3,9
"8892","Leela: Sure!
",41,3,9
"8893","Adlai: I don't know what else to say, so I'll just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.
",41,3,9
"8894","Fry: This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
",41,3,9
"8895","Leela: You're just jealous!
",41,3,9
"8896","Fry: No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!
",41,3,9
"8897","Leela: Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life.
",41,3,9
"8898","Zoidberg: Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor.
",41,3,9
"8899","Leela: Actually, most doctors are rich.
",41,3,9
"8900","Zoidberg: What? When did this happen? You're joking, right? [He shakes her.] That's not funny!
",41,3,9
"8901","Bender: OK, they've got everything you need here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back. That's one of the things you kids do, right?
",41,3,9
"8902","Albert: Yeah.
",41,3,9
"8903","Bender: Then knock yourself out. [The kids scream and run off, eating things and spinning around on bar stools.] Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
",41,3,9
"8904","Nina: Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!
",41,3,9
"8905","Bender: Here.
",41,3,9
"8906","Fembot: These kids yours?
",41,3,9
"8907","Bender: Yeah.
",41,3,9
"8908","Fembot: Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!
",41,3,9
"8909","Bender: That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun.
",41,3,9
"8910","Boy: Daddy Bender?
",41,3,9
"8911","Bender: Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!
",41,3,9
"8912","Boy: I love you, Daddy Bender!
",41,3,9
"8913","Bender: Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!
",41,3,9
"8914","Fembot: I guess you're busy. I'll catch you later.
",41,3,9
"8915","Bender: You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it! [The kids cheer.] [grumbling] Oh, come on!
",41,3,9
"8916","Adlai: I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary, a place no one could object to.
",41,3,9
"8917","Leela: That sounds wonderful.
",41,3,9
"8918","Man #4: I'd like an extra-beautiful bouquet for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.
",41,3,9
"8919","Adlai: Average, please.
",41,3,9
"8920","Leela: Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird.
",41,3,9
"8921","Adlai: Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!
",41,3,9
"8922","Leela: Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
",41,3,9
"8923","Zoidberg: [mesmerised] Totally.
",41,3,9
"8924","Adlai: Uh, listen. I just want you all to know your Leela's one standard lady.
",41,3,9
"8925","Leela: Oh, Adlai, stop!
",41,3,9
"8926","Fry: What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
",41,3,9
"8927","Zoidberg: Damn right!
",41,3,9
"8928","Fry: And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot. [Farnsworth blubbers and waves.] Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.
",41,3,9
"8929","Hermes: Tally me banana.
",41,3,9
"8930","Fry: Amy's a klutz from Mars.
",41,3,9
"8931","Amy: Sploops!
",41,3,9
"8932","Farnsworth: And, Fry, you've got that brain thing.
",41,3,9
"8933","Fry: I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?
",41,3,9
"8934","Leela: That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
",41,3,9
"8935","Farnsworth: She's right!
",41,3,9
"8936","Zoidberg: No doubt about it.
",41,3,9
"8937","Amy: Duh!
",41,3,9
"8938","Hermes: Daylight come!
",41,3,9
"8939","Bender: Coming through, watch your heads!
",41,3,9
"8940","Zoidberg: Help! I'm under attack!
",41,3,9
"8941","Bender: Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right.
",41,3,9
"8942","Elzar: Which one of you cutie muffins gets the children's spicy squab?
",41,3,9
"8943","Sam: Me!
",41,3,9
"8944","Bender: Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
",41,3,9
"8945","Sam: 'Bout time!
",41,3,9
"8946","Bender: That's my boy!
",41,3,9
"8947","Elzar: And here's your check. Bam!
",41,3,9
"8948","Albert: I gotta go poopy!
",41,3,9
"8949","Bender: Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!
",41,3,9
"8950","Elzar: [shouting] You little crooks! If I catch you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!
",41,3,9
"8951","Adlai: You know, seeing that strange robot force 12 children to do his bidding makes me think about kids of our own.
",41,3,9
"8952","Leela: Us? Me? You? Kids?
",41,3,9
"8953","Adlai: That's correct. It's time to stop living this vida bachelor loca, settle down and have kids.
",41,3,9
"8954","Leela: Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
",41,3,9
"8955","Albert: Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.
",41,3,9
"8956","Bender: Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.
",41,3,9
"8957","Sally: Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.
",41,3,9
"8958","Kids: [chanting] Story! Story! Story!
",41,3,9
"8959","Bender: Alright, fine, gather round.
",41,3,9
"8960","Nina: We wanna hear this one again!
",41,3,9
"8961","Bender: [reading] ""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting.
",41,3,9
"8962","Albert: Yeah, show us the picture! [Bender shows them a picture of him with a stolen watch on his arm. The kids laugh.] There he is!
",41,3,9
"8963","Bender: OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed. [The kids groan.] The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma.
",41,3,9
"8964","Bender: Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps! [He and Fry sit down at a cable spool that has been turned over to make a table. Bender looks over his accounts and mutters.] Oh! I need a calculator.
",41,3,9
"8965","Fry: You are a calculator.
",41,3,9
"8966","Bender: I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper-- [He gasps.] I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!
",41,3,9
"8967","Fry: There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
",41,3,9
"8968","Bender: I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
",41,3,9
"8969","Sam: Daddy, how do I flush you?
",41,3,9
"8970","Bender: [shouting] Just go to bed!
",41,3,9
"8971","Adlai: You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you all the more.
",41,3,9
"8972","Leela: Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.
",41,3,9
"8973","Adlai: Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, it's more than acceptable, it's adequately satisfactory!
",41,3,9
"8974","Bender: Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check. [He picks up Albert.] Oh, aren't you a cutie? [He puts him down and picks up the phone.] About 35lbs. [Fry taps his shoulder.] What?
",41,3,9
"8975","Leela: Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.
",41,3,9
"8976","Bender: Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?
",41,3,9
"8977","Adlai: Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.
",41,3,9
"8978","Bender: Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock.
",41,3,9
"8979","Leela: I remember this from when we were kids: The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
",41,3,9
"8980","Albert: I'm Albert.
",41,3,9
"8981","Leela: Kind of fatty.
",41,3,9
"8982","Bender: Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
",41,3,9
"8983","Leela: Uh, um.
",41,3,9
"8984","Adlai: Hmm.
",41,3,9
"8985","Bender: If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. [He picks up Sally, who is wearing a sash with ""As Is"" written on her.] Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called ""love"".
",41,3,9
"8986","Sally: One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.
",41,3,9
"8987","Leela: Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it.
",41,3,9
"8988","Bender: OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed.
",41,3,9
"8989","Albert: But it's 10 in the morning!
",41,3,9
"8990","Bender: I said hit the hay!
",41,3,9
"8991","Leela: Oh, they're all so adorable.
",41,3,9
"8992","Bender: Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England.
",41,3,9
"8993","Smitty: You're under arrest for child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children as food and misrepresenting the weight of livestock.
",41,3,9
"8994","Bender: If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!
",41,3,9
"8995","Leela: Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?
",41,3,9
"8996","Smitty: Might as well. They're just gonna rot in the evidence locker.
",41,3,9
"8997","Orphan #1: Nice ear!
",41,3,9
"8998","Orphan #2: Hey, freaky ears!
",41,3,9
"8999","Orphan #3: How's you hearing?
",41,3,9
"9000","Leela: I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
",41,3,9
"9001","Adlai: Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.
",41,3,9
"9002","Leela: Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad.
",41,3,9
"9003","Kids: [chanting] Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally won the ugly race!
",41,3,9
"9004","Adlai: On the other hand, the children bring up a good point. She does have an ear on her face.
",41,3,9
"9005","Leela: Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
",41,3,9
"9006","Adlai: Oh, alright. If you really want that one, I can give her an operation to make her acceptable.
",41,3,9
"9007","Leela: She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
",41,3,9
"9008","Adlai: Oh, and I suppose you were fine the way you were?
",41,3,9
"9009","Leela: Damn right I was!
",41,3,9
"9010","Fry: Yay!
",41,3,9
"9011","Leela: Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age.
",41,3,9
"9012","Sally: I also have a tail!
",41,3,9
"9013","Leela: Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
",41,3,9
"9014","Adlai: Why should I do that?
",41,3,9
"9015","Leela: Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye.
",41,3,9
"9016","Vogel: In recognition of Bender's generous gift of 12 orphans and a government cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez Orphanarium!
",41,3,9
"9017","Fry: It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
",41,3,9
"9018","Leela: Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird.
",41,3,9
"9019","Fry: Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.
",41,3,9
"9020","Albert: We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.
",41,3,9
"9021","Nina: We know robots don't have emotions but we drawed you this picture.
",41,3,9
"9022","Sally: So if you ever miss us, even just a teeny bit, you can look at it.
",41,3,9
"9023","Bender: Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh! [He screws it up and throws it in his chest cabinet. The kids sigh and walk away. Bender checks they're gone and takes the screwed up paper out of his cabinet and sticks it to the inside of his door. He sighs. The kids cheer, run back and jump on him.] Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! [shouting] I hate you! I hate you all!

"9027","Mrs. Wong: Howdy, friends! Welcome to Mars!
",42,3,10
"9028","Leela: Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue.
",42,3,10
"9029","Mr. Wong: Oh, Mars Day much better than Earth Day. Dump trash wherever you want! Big, empty planet!
",42,3,10
"9030","Mrs. Wong: OK, then. Make yourselves at home.
",42,3,10
"9031","Zoidberg: Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway.
",42,3,10
"9032","Farnsworth: This is quite a large ranch you have.
",42,3,10
"9033","Mr. Wong: 17.9 billion acres. We own entire western hemisphere. [whispering] That the best hemisphere!
",42,3,10
"9034","Farnsworth: It's the same on Earth.
",42,3,10
"9035","Mr. Wong: Here is most number one product of all: The mighty buggalo. They used for everything; meat, milk and their shells make good row boat.

",42,3,10
"9037","Hermes: Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle.
",42,3,10
"9038","Mr. Wong: Not really. We own so much stuff it easier just to brand everything that not ours.
",42,3,10
"9039","Hermes: Please don't do that.
",42,3,10
"9040","Amy: Betsy! [It licks Amy. The rest of the staff gather around.] This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters.

",42,3,10
"9044","Mrs. Wong: I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren. This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger.
",42,3,10
"9045","Zapp: Now remember, Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them and you're in.

"9046","Kif: Actually, sir, I'm-I'm a little nervous about meeting her family.
",42,3,10
"9047","Zapp: Well that's natural. After all you're meek and uninteresting. Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite.

",42,3,10
"9053","Mrs. Wong: It commemorate the day centuries ago when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, bought Mars from stupid natives.

"9057","Leela: I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people.
",42,3,10
"9058","Fry: Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!
",42,3,10
"9059","Leela: Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
",42,3,10
"9060","Kif: Amy, no! Not on your parents' planet!
",42,3,10
"9061","RJ: Howdy, Amy. Glad to see you've come back to the country. It's where the flavour is.
",42,3,10
"9062","Amy: RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif.
",42,3,10
"9063","RJ: This wimp? You've gone a long way, baby. [He takes out a cigarette box.] Cigarette, partner?
",42,3,10
"9064","Kif: Oh, I don't--
",42,3,10
"9065","RJ: I haven't even lit it yet!
",42,3,10
"9066","Kif: Oh. Is it lit now?
",42,3,10
"9067","RJ: Yep. [Kif coughs and spits the cigarette out. RJ catches it and smokes it.] You're pathetic!
",42,3,10
"9068","Zoidberg: Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
",42,3,10
"9069","Mr. Wong: You here five hours and already you tear up couch, draw moustache on priceless painting and fill pool with brine shrimp.
",42,3,10
"9070","Zoidberg: [nudging Mrs. Wong] Not bad for a city boy, huh? [Mr. Wong takes a bite of caviar.] By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar.
",42,3,10
"9071","Amy: Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
",42,3,10
"9072","Kif: You don't understand. When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex. [He turns transparent.] Oh, dear! [He paces.] Oh, goodness! Oh, odds and bodkins!
",42,3,10
"9073","Fry: I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
",42,3,10
"9074","Mr. Wong: You want some salad with that?
",42,3,10
"9075","Fry: Yuck!
",42,3,10
"9076","Amy: Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
",42,3,10
"9077","Mr. Wong: This your boyfriend? I have instant dislike of him!
",42,3,10
"9078","Mrs. Wong: He too scrawny to father grandchildren.
",42,3,10
"9079","Amy: He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned.
",42,3,10
"9080","Kif: Actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--
",42,3,10
"9081","Mr. Wong: Yes, yes! You a big squishy wuss! Amy should be dating real man. Like him!
",42,3,10
"9082","Kif: I can be manly too. I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke.
",42,3,10
"9083","Amy: [whispering] Wrong way!
",42,3,10
"9084","Kif: [wheezy] Smooth!
",42,3,10
"9085","Amy: Look on the bright side: My parents left after you passed out so they didn't even see you barf.
",42,3,10
"9086","Kif: Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter.
",42,3,10
"9087","Amy: It's OK, Kif. [Kif whimpers.] I'll go get you a tissue from your tote.
",42,3,10
"9088","RJ: Hey there, Amy. Like you to meet my buddy, Joe.
",42,3,10
"9089","Joe: Sorry I'm late. My pool game ran long at the jazz club!

",42,3,10

",42,3,10
"9093","Mrs. Wong: Phew! Everyone OK? No one considering lawsuit?
",42,3,10
"9094","Farnsworth: Hmm. I might have mental anguish.

",42,3,10
"9096","Farnsworth: I'm OK then.
",42,3,10
"9097","Mrs. Wong: Storm dying down. Leo, check if buggalo herd is OK.
",42,3,10
"9098","Mr. Wong: Oh!
",42,3,10
"9099","Leela: What happened to the buggalo?
",42,3,10
"9100","Mr. Wong: They been rustled under cover of storm. We ruined!

",42,3,10
"9102","Amy: Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK.
",42,3,10

",42,3,10
"9105","Kif: Lieutenant Kif Kroker!
",42,3,10
"9106","Hermes: Alright then.
",42,3,10
"9107","Mr. Wong: Aye-ah! Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful. Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!
",42,3,10
"9108","Mrs. Wong: OK. I want a divorce.
",42,3,10
"9109","Zoidberg: Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
",42,3,10
"9110","Amy: They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart.
",42,3,10
"9111","Zoidberg: Aw!
",42,3,10
"9112","Amy: Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
",42,3,10
"9113","Kif: Mrs. Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?
",42,3,10
"9114","Kif: My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle drive. Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!
",42,3,10
"9115","Farnsworth: It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him.
",42,3,10
"9116","Fry: Aw, man!
",42,3,10
"9117","Kif: Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Wong. I'll get your cattle back or die trying.
",42,3,10
"9118","Mr. Wong: Hey, we can't lose!
",42,3,10
"9119","Amy: No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness.
",42,3,10
"9120","Mrs. Wong: Oh, yes he does!
",42,3,10
"9121","RJ: Here are your mounts!
",42,3,10
"9122","Leela: She's got a fine coat.
",42,3,10
"9123","Kif: Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers. How many are left?
",42,3,10
"9124","Amy: You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit. [Betsy leaps onto Kif.] Aw, she likes you!
",42,3,10
"9125","Kif: Saddle up, men. We got some no good rustlers to ... catch!
",42,3,10
"9126","Bender: [singing] : We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers,
Somebody wants to pick a fight with us,
He'd better bite my ass!
",42,3,10
"9127","Fry: Yee-haw!
",42,3,10
"9128","Leela: Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system.
",42,3,10
"9129","Fry: Where?
",42,3,10
"9130","Leela: Right in front of you.
",42,3,10
"9131","Fry: Oh. Oh!
",42,3,10
"9132","Kif: We'll camp near the top. The rustlers will be sure to spot us there.
",42,3,10
"9133","Fry: Where?
",42,3,10
"9134","Bender: And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!
",42,3,10
"9135","Fry: Pft, that's not scary!
",42,3,10
"9136","Bender: It is if you're a laser printer.
",42,3,10
"9137","Leela: OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--
",42,3,10
"9138","Fry: Hook on the hand!
",42,3,10
"9139","Kif: OK, I've got one. This family--
",42,3,10
"9140","Fry: Man in the attic!
",42,3,10
"9141","Leela: Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!
",42,3,10
"9142","Fry: With pleasure. [spookily] Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--
",42,3,10
"9143","Bender: [speaking fast] Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! [normal] Sorry, go on.
",42,3,10
"9144","Fry: And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--
",42,3,10
"9145","Amy: [from bushes] Surprise!
",42,3,10
"9146","Kif: Amy? What are you doing here?
",42,3,10
"9147","Amy: I forgot to give you something before you left.
",42,3,10
"9148","Kif: What?
",42,3,10
"9149","Amy: Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
",42,3,10
"9150","Kif: I love it out here, Amy. I feel so manly. I have a blister, I-I spit! A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings.
",42,3,10
"9151","Amy: But you still have them, right?
",42,3,10
"9152","Kif: Oh, yes. But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary.
",42,3,10
"9153","Amy: Ah, it's a wonderful night.
",42,3,10
"9154","Kif: It sure is. I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night.
",42,3,10
"9155","Amy: I can't! [She kisses him and the ground shakes.] What's that?
",42,3,10
"9156","Kif: Maybe we just made love.
",42,3,10
"9157","Amy: The buggalo! They're in the crater.
",42,3,10
"9158","Kif: The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared.
",42,3,10
"9159","Amy: Oh, Kif! You're so brave!
",42,3,10
"9160","Kif: [nervous] Sh! They'll hear us!
",42,3,10
"9161","Kif: OK, the dynamite's in place.
",42,3,10
"9162","Amy: Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
",42,3,10
"9163","Leela: Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
",42,3,10
"9164","Amy: Well, actually--
",42,3,10
"9165","Bender: Too late! This is more fun!
",42,3,10
"9166","Amy: Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
",42,3,10
"9167","Kif: I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune. The principle is essentially the same.
",42,3,10
"9168","Fry: Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again.
",42,3,10
"9169","Leela: [shouting] Sandstorm! [The tornado picks up the buggalo and them. They tumble around inside the tornado and then fall to the ground.] We're in the eye of the storm!
",42,3,10
"9170","Fry: Where?
",42,3,10
"9171","Bender: What's that?
",42,3,10
"9172","Fry: My God!
",42,3,10
"9173","Leela: Who are they?
",42,3,10
"9174","Singing Wind: Fehk! We are the Native Martians.
",42,3,10
"9175","Fry: Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.
",42,3,10
"9176","Singing Wind: Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo. And only they shall have buggalo. And they're us.
",42,3,10
"9177","Kif: But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours. They belong to the Wong family.
",42,3,10
"9178","Singing Wind: You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?
",42,3,10
"9179","Amy: Uh-huh! Amy Wong. [She holds out her hand.] And you are?
",42,3,10
"9180","Singing Wind: Mad at Wong family! We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo. But now we take girl instead.
",42,3,10
"9181","Amy: Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
",42,3,10
"9182","Kif: Amy! Nooo!
",42,3,10
"9183","Bender: Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you.
",42,3,10
"9184","Mr. Wong: Hooray! You bring back cattle.
",42,3,10
"9185","Kif: Yes ... but ... I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well.
",42,3,10
"9186","Mrs. Wong: Let Amy tell us. That way it soften the blow. [There is silence.] Why Amy being so quiet?
",42,3,10
"9187","Kif: Um ... well, um ... that is, um...
",42,3,10
"9188","Mr. Wong: Oh, no! Martians kidnap Amy! [Inside it says ""We Take Daughter. Us Want Land"" and there is a picture of Amy blindfolded, holding today's newspaper.] I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar.
",42,3,10
"9189","Kif: I'll get your daughter back, sir. I swear.
",42,3,10
"9190","Mr. Wong: Forget it, squishy. You the one lose her in first place. You done enough.
",42,3,10
"9191","Mrs. Wong: Yeah. This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!
",42,3,10
"9192","Kif: You mean-- Oh, no, please. I beg you! Oh, for the love of--
",42,3,10
"9193","Zapp: I am the man with no name. Zapp Brannigan, at your service!
",42,3,10
"9194","Mrs. Wong: Please, Mr. Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back.
",42,3,10
"9195","Zapp: Very well. I'll clean up Kif's mess. I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally. [The Wongs gasp.] Your gasps intrigue me. Explain.
",42,3,10
"9196","Mr. Wong: Martians have no land. They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground. No one ever dare go there.
",42,3,10
"9197","Farnsworth: This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--
",42,3,10
"9198","Bender: Damn you, old man!
",42,3,10
"9199","Leela: Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!
",42,3,10
"9200","Zapp: I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!
",42,3,10
"9201","Kif: She won't leave me alone.
",42,3,10
"9202","Zapp: Did I say ""girlfriend""? She sounds more like a wife!
",42,3,10
"9203","Zapp: Behold: The Great Stone Face of Mars.
",42,3,10
"9204","Fry: Hm.
",42,3,10
"9205","Zapp: The only known entrance to the Martian reservation.
",42,3,10
"9206","Leela: What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
",42,3,10
"9207","Zapp: Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet.
",42,3,10
"9208","Zapp: Nose-ward, ho!
",42,3,10
"9209","Singing Wind: Fehk! I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe.
",42,3,10
"9210","Zapp: Take me to your leader.
",42,3,10
"9211","Singing Wind: Moving along. Why you trespass on our land?
",42,3,10
"9212","Zapp: We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong. And just to clarify: Land is the stuff that has sky over it.
",42,3,10
"9213","Leela: They have such respect for the planet.
",42,3,10
"9214","Martian #1: Cynthia used to drink Slurm.
",42,3,10
"9215","Singing Wind: We will give back girl when we get back planet surface.
",42,3,10
"9216","Zapp: How do we even know she's alive?
",42,3,10
"9217","Amy: I'm fine.
",42,3,10
"9218","Zapp: Sh! You're weakening our bargaining position. How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?
",42,3,10
"9219","Singing Wind: You waste words. We want return of land that was taken from us.
",42,3,10
"9220","Bender: Uh, actually you traded it for a bead.
",42,3,10
"9221","Singing Wind: Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse. We want land back!
",42,3,10
"9222","Zapp: Chief, my people are a people of law. And that law is ... [He pulls out a gun.] ... no backsies!
",42,3,10
"9223","Singing Wind: The time for stupid statements is over!
",42,3,10
"9224","Zapp: Oh, boy!
",42,3,10
"9225","Leela: Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!
",42,3,10
"9226","Zoidberg: [from inside] Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
",42,3,10

",42,3,10

",42,3,10
"9231","Leela: Yay, Kif!
",42,3,10
"9232","Zapp: Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!
",42,3,10
"9233","Singing Wind: We have misjudged you, green one. You fly the buggalo like us. You have true reverence for Mother Mars. Let there be peace between us.
",42,3,10
"9234","Martian #2: Yes. Let us smoke-em peace pipe.
",42,3,10
"9235","Kif: Smoke-em?
",42,3,10
"9236","Singing Wind: Here, take.
",42,3,10
"9237","Kif: Ooh, no thanks. I'm on the peace patch.
",42,3,10
"9238","Singing Wind: You must smoke peace pipe, and you must do it peacefully. Or we'll kill you.
",42,3,10
"9239","Kif: Well, it's just really that I don't feel that--
",42,3,10
"9240","Zapp: Don't be such a chicken, Kif. Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on-the-ball.
",42,3,10
"9241","Fry: Yeah!
",42,3,10
"9242","Zapp: Yes, sir!
",42,3,10
"9243","Bender: Way to suck it!
",42,3,10
"9244","Kif: Hey, I'm smoking! I'm the greatest! [He takes another puff. Singing Wind pats him on the back. Kif coughs and splutters and the Martians gasp.] Oh, monkey trumpets!
",42,3,10
"9245","Singing Wind: You have coughed at our offer of peace. So you must die!
",42,3,10
"9246","Martian #3: The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones.
",42,3,10
"9247","Kif: Well, actually, I don't have bones. I'm supported by a system of fluid-filled bladders that--
",42,3,10
"9248","Fry: Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
",42,3,10
"9249","Leela: It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
",42,3,10
"9250","Singing Wind: Really?
",42,3,10
"9251","Bender: Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!
",42,3,10
"9252","Amy: Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it.
",42,3,10
"9253","Singing Wind: Hmm. We always thought bead was worthless. We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership.
",42,3,10
"9254","Bender: So we can have the diamond?
",42,3,10
"9255","Singing Wind: No. We do have concept of ownership. You are free to go. Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping.
",42,3,10
"9256","Leela: But what about your sacred land?
",42,3,10
"9257","Singing Wind: Land shmand! We don't wanna live on this planet. It's a dump. We'll buy new planet and act like it's sacred. With cash like this, who's going to argue? Nobody, that's who!
",42,3,10
"9258","Amy: Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians.
",42,3,10
"9259","Mr. Wong: Please! He too much of a wimp.
",42,3,10
"9260","Mrs. Wong: Yeah. I'm sure it was all Mr. Zapp Brannigan here.

"9265","Kif: Oh, you're kind. But your parents still don't like me.

"9278","Fry: Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?
",43,3,11
"9279","Bender: I thought you were retired.
",43,3,11
"9280","Fry: Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age.
",43,3,11
"9281","Bender: I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off"".
",43,3,11
"9282","Fry: Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund. [He takes a $100 bill out of his sock.] Damn! Still only $100.
",43,3,11
"9283","Franklin: [on bill] A penny saved is a penny earned. Also, could you get some athlete's foot cream for my face?
",43,3,11
"9284","Fry: He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
",43,3,11
"9285","Fry: Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. [He scratches a panel on the ""Whiff-n-Win"" ticket.] Cherry. [Another panel.] Cherry! [The last one.] Mule. Crud!
",43,3,11
"9286","Bender: So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles.
",43,3,11
"9287","Teller: You're opening a retirement account for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ... [She sniffs.] ... mule farmer like yourself is aware that we charge a $10 monthly fee.
",43,3,11
"9288","Fry: [shrugging] You gotta spend money to make money.
",43,3,11
"9289","Teller: Here you are, sir. Your account is now overdrawn by $4.
",43,3,11
"9290","Robot: Gee, I've seen lines move faster in a sperm bank.
",43,3,11
"9291","Bender: That's for sure-- [He turns around.] Roberto! Is that you?
",43,3,11
"9292","Roberto: Bender! Hey, man!
",43,3,11
"9293","Bender: You old lunatic! How you been?
",43,3,11
"9294","Roberto: Not bad, not bad. [He pulls out a knife.] Everybody on the floor! This is a stick-up!
",43,3,11
"9295","Bender: Yeah, I'm doing OK too. [The teller hands Roberto several bags of money.] I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex.
",43,3,11
"9296","Roberto: Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?
",43,3,11
"9297","Bender: Sure thing, pal.
",43,3,11
"9298","Roberto: Hey, you! Red! [He cuts the top off the plant.] Quit watering that plant and get the door!
",43,3,11
"9299","Bender: Well, nice talking to you.
",43,3,11
"9300","Roberto: Same here. [He takes the money from Bender and puts his arms around their shoulders.] You guys are alright! Here's something for your trouble.

",43,3,11
"9304","Bailiff: Court is in session. The Honourable Judge Whitey presiding.
",43,3,11
"9305","Whitey: The charge is bank robbery. Now, my caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested. Therefore, robbing a bank is tantamount to that most heinous of crimes, theft of money.
",43,3,11
"9306","Hyper-Chicken: As the surveillance camera for the bank what all the judge was a-jawing about, could y'all tell us what you done seen the day of the crime?
",43,3,11
"9307","Camera: Well, let's see. My memory's a little fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:
",43,3,11
"9308","Hyper-Chicken: Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred for introducing this evidence against my own clients.
",43,3,11
"9309","Hyper-Chicken: Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?
",43,3,11
"9310","Fry: I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
",43,3,11
"9311","Leela: [shouting] Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
",43,3,11
"9312","Fry: You're right. You're right. It was--
",43,3,11
"9313","Whitey: Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll be killed? Oh. It's for you.
",43,3,11
"9314","Roberto: [on phone] ...and the other hamburger will...
",43,3,11
"9315","Roberto: ...also be made of your lungs. So long, pal.
",43,3,11
"9316","Fry: I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty.
",43,3,11
"9317","Whitey: Ah, the 67th Amendment.
",43,3,11
"9318","Hyper-Chicken: I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken but I know when we're finger-licked. Whattya say we plead insanity?
",43,3,11
"9319","Bender: A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
",43,3,11
"9320","Hyper-Chicken: If you start now, it might help our case.
",43,3,11
"9321","Whitey: Counselor, what evidence do you offer to support this new plea of insanity?
",43,3,11
"9322","Hyper-Chicken: Well, for one, they done hired me to represent them.
",43,3,11
"9323","Whitey: Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, I hereby commit you to the asylum for criminally insane robots until such time as you are deemed cured.
",43,3,11
"9324","Bender: Yahoo! The system fails again!
",43,3,11
"9325","Whitey: And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the home for criminally insane humans.
",43,3,11
"9326","Bailiff: Your Honour, that facility has been full ever since you ruled that being poor is a mental illness.
",43,3,11
"9327","Whitey: [banging gavel] Order! Order! The only poor people I want to hear about are the people who tend to my pores at the spa. Just send them both to the robot loony bin and let's go.

",43,3,11
"9330","Fry: [from box] Ow! My chin!

"9335","Bender: [shouting] I find that offensive!
",43,3,11
"9336","Dr. Perceptron: Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let me give you something to help you relax.
",43,3,11
"9337","Fry: Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See? [He lifts up his gown and grabs his belly.] I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.
",43,3,11
"9338","Dr. Perceptron: Yes, you do. You need to relax more. [He gives Fry another shock.] Terrific. Now, consider the following: You were admitted to this robot asylum. Therefore, you must be a robot. Diagnosis complete.

"9358","Fry: Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?
",43,3,11
"9359","Unit 2013: Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's got multiple personalities -- all of them Lincoln.
",43,3,11
"9360","Lincolnbot: I was born in 200 log cabins.
",43,3,11
"9361","Unit 2013: And this here is Frankie. He's convinced he's a lunchroom worker, so they put him to work in the lunchroom. [patronising] How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?

",43,3,11
"9367","Fry: But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!

"9491","Fry: A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!
",43,3,11
"9492","Zoidberg: Also good.
",43,3,11
"9493","Leela: Thanks for saving us, Fry.
",43,3,11
"9494","Fry: I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
",43,3,11
"9495","Bender: Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot.
",43,3,11
"9496","Fry: Aw. Thanks, Bender.
",43,3,11
"9497","Bender: Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human. [He takes one out and everyone gasps and cringes.] What?
",43,3,11
"9498","Bender: [over credits] What?
",43,3,11
"9499","Bender: Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference.
",44,3,12
"9500","Fry: How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it.
",44,3,12
"9501","Bender: Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
",44,3,12
"9502","Fry: I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
",44,3,12
"9503","Bender: Baby wants a Zima!
",44,3,12
"9504","Leela: Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?
",44,3,12
"9505","Bender: You can brew your own beer?
",44,3,12
"9506","Leela: Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
",44,3,12
"9507","Hermes: Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son, suspended from boarding school.
",44,3,12
"9508","Dwight: It's not my fault, Dad.
",44,3,12
"9509","Farnsworth: And you, Cubert! I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there.
",44,3,12
"9510","Cubert: Nuh-uh!
",44,3,12
"9511","Zoidberg: What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted-hearing-aid yelling?
",44,3,12
"9512","Hermes: I'm afraid it's both.
",44,3,12
"9513","Farnsworth: [shouting] What?
",44,3,12
"9514","LaBarbara: Now hold on. Everyone, cool your daiquiris! Let's give the little vermin a chance to explain themselves.
",44,3,12
"9515","Dwight: It was self defence, Mom. Just look at this letter the principal sent. [He puts the letter in a machine. Cubert's and Dwight's classroom appears on the TV.] We were in science class and we had just finished building a miniature black hole.
",44,3,12
"9516","Cubert: [on TV] That was easy.
",44,3,12
"9517","Bret: [on TV] Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be hungry.
",44,3,12
"9518","Cubert: [on TV] Duh! Black holes don't need food.
",44,3,12
"9519","Bret: [on TV] Neither do nerds!
",44,3,12
"9520","Dwight: [on TV] My Manwich!
",44,3,12
"9521","Cubert: [on TV] That's it, Bret. You've compressed our lunches to a singularity for the last time! Salt him, Dwight!
",44,3,12
"9522","Bret: [on TV] When I re-solidify, I'm gonna put you in a world of goop!
",44,3,12
"9523","Cubert: See? That bully started it. We couldn't fight back with brawn so we used our brains!
",44,3,12
"9524","Farnsworth: I've warned you not to use those things!
",44,3,12
"9525","Leela: Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in.
",44,3,12
"9526","Bender: Yo!
",44,3,12
"9527","Leela: Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
",44,3,12
"9528","Hermes: Dwight, you remember the crew.
",44,3,12
"9529","Dwight: [unenthusiastic] Eh.
",44,3,12
"9530","Farnsworth: Crew, you remember Cubert? [The crew respond without enthusiasm.] Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!
",44,3,12
"9531","Cubert: Well, well. [He looks at Leela.] If it isn't my old friend, stretch pants ... [He looks at Bender.] ... no pants and ... [He looks at Fry.] ... idiot!
",44,3,12
"9532","Bender: We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
",44,3,12
"9533","Dwight: I heard alcohol makes you stupid.
",44,3,12
"9534","Fry: No I'm ... doesn't.
",44,3,12
"9535","Leela: Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!
",44,3,12
"9536","Dwight: Aw, man!
",44,3,12
"9537","Cubert: I'm sick of this.
",44,3,12
"9538","Cubert: Hey, Dad. What useless contraption are you half-baking today?
",44,3,12
"9539","Farnsworth: Eh, wha? Oh! This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!
",44,3,12
"9540","Cubert: [Farnsworth's voice] Good news, everyone! I'm a horse's butt!
",44,3,12
"9541","Farnsworth: I am? That's not good news at all, you little--
",44,3,12
"9542","Dwight: What's this devices marketability? Who's the target consumer?
",44,3,12
"9543","Farnsworth: There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice! [He speaks through the machine and there is feedback.] Now quit pestering me, you scoundrels!
",44,3,12
"9544","Hermes: [singing] Stamp it, file it. Oh, yeah! Send it overnight!
",44,3,12
"9545","Dwight: Can I collate that?
",44,3,12
"9546","Hermes: No!
",44,3,12
"9547","Cubert: Can I shred these contracts?
",44,3,12
"9548","Hermes: No!
",44,3,12
"9549","Dwight: Wow! A power-stamper!
",44,3,12
"9550","Hermes: Now look at all the work I gotta do! [He stamps ""void"" stamps over the others. He stamps his head.] Ow!
",44,3,12
"9551","Leela: Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
",44,3,12
"9552","Bender: Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? [crying] It's so beautiful.
",44,3,12
"9553","Leela: Talk to me.
",44,3,12
"9554","Farnsworth: [on communicator] This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew. You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8, a planet at the edge of the universe.
",44,3,12
"9555","Cubert: [Farnsworth's voice] Sorry I can't come down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing useless junk.
",44,3,12
"9556","Dwight: [Farnsworth's voice] And I smell bad.
",44,3,12
"9557","Cubert: Hey!
",44,3,12
"9558","Leela: If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate.
",44,3,12
"9559","Farnsworth: Oh, bother! What have they done now?
",44,3,12
"9560","Bender: Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.
",44,3,12
"9561","Fry: The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7.
",44,3,12
"9562","Hermes: Child man, is this true?
",44,3,12
"9563","Dwight: Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously fake mission.
",44,3,12
"9564","Cubert: [pointing at Bender] Plus, they're making bootleg beer inside company property!
",44,3,12
"9565","Bender: [shouting] Lies! Lies and slander!
",44,3,12
"9566","Farnsworth: Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
",44,3,12
"9567","Hermes: You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.
",44,3,12
"9568","Bender: Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
",44,3,12
"9569","Hermes: Get a job, you lazy kids!
",44,3,12
"9570","Bender: I guess if you want children beaten ... [He pulls out a blernsball bat.] ... you have to do it yourself.
",44,3,12
"9571","Cubert: Come on, Dad, shuffle faster!
",44,3,12
"9572","Dwight: You don't wanna miss the unveiling of our new company, do you?
",44,3,12
"9573","Hermes: Company? [He laughs.] How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
",44,3,12
"9574","Farnsworth: Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!
",44,3,12
"9575","Cubert: Actually, we're starting a competing delivery company.
",44,3,12
"9576","Hermes: Welcome to the world of business!
",44,3,12
"9577","Farnsworth: Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody, that's who!
",44,3,12
"9578","Dwight: But we already have a client signed up. We're delivering the Daily Supernova.
",44,3,12
"9579","Hermes: So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route?
",44,3,12
"9580","Farnsworth: Phew!
",44,3,12
"9581","Dwight: No! It's a serious business.
",44,3,12
"9582","Farnsworth: Yes it's a tremendous responsibility, alright! [He chuckles.] What if a paper were to land in a puddle?
",44,3,12
"9583","Hermes: Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
",44,3,12
"9584","Dwight: Why do they always treat us like dumb kids? We're practically old enough to find the Fox Network infantile!
",44,3,12
"9585","Cubert: We'll show 'em. All Awesome Express needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery craft. [He shows Dwight an advert for a hovercraft.] Voilà! You got a quarter?
",44,3,12
"9586","Dwight: Man, the ad said to allow four to six seconds for delivery.
",44,3,12
"9587","Cubert: More like seven!
",44,3,12
"9588","Bender: I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
",44,3,12
"9589","Fry: No, you have a healthy glow.
",44,3,12
"9590","Bender: Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!
",44,3,12
"9591","Leela: Ooh! Let me feel. [She and Fry sit next to Bender. She puts her ear to his chest.] Have you thought about what to name it?
",44,3,12
"9592","Bender: I was thinking ""Benderbrau"" if it's an ale, ""Botweiser"" if it's a lager.
",44,3,12
"9593","Fry: I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game. [Bender belches again. Leela giggles.] Ooh, I felt that one!
",44,3,12
"9594","Cubert: Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. That could cause explosive decompression.
",44,3,12
"9595","Dwight: Put a sticker on it.
",44,3,12
"9596","Hermes: Off on your first delivery, eh? You be careful, my little tinkler. [He pinches Dwight's cheek.] Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler?
",44,3,12
"9597","Sal: Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday edition can dos that.
",44,3,12
"9598","Farnsworth: Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50.
",44,3,12
"9599","Cubert: Yeah, if you're an idiot!
",44,3,12
"9600","Dwight: Three, two, one.
",44,3,12
"9601","Cubert: All systems go.
",44,3,12
"9602","Dwight: Blast-off!
",44,3,12
"9603","Hermes: [shouting] See you at din-din!
",44,3,12
"9604","Farnsworth: [shouting] I'm blowing you a kiss.
",44,3,12
"9605","Cubert: Take evasive action!
",44,3,12
"9606","Farnsworth: [shouting] It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And ... gotcha!
",44,3,12
"9607","Cubert: [screaming] Nooo!
",44,3,12
"9608","Hermes: Business is down, so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves.
",44,3,12
"9609","Farnsworth: Well, well. If it isn't our little munchkin moguls!
",44,3,12
"9610","Hermes: What's the trouble, men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?
",44,3,12
"9611","Cubert: Actually, thanks to Dwight's brilliant accounting and my unaccountable brilliance ... [He snorts.] ... our paper route now has over a million customers!
",44,3,12
"9612","Dwight: We're finally making more money than you guys! Aren't you impressed now, Pops? Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?
",44,3,12
"9613","Hermes: Uh, in a small way, yes. But you still don't have your own building or conference table or ... or one of those things!
",44,3,12
"9614","Zoidberg: Hello!
",44,3,12
"9615","Dwight: Our dads are never impressed, no matter what we do.
",44,3,12
"9616","Cubert: Maybe we should start a fire.
",44,3,12
"9617","Dwight: If we really wanna impress them we'll have to crush them with strategy ... Dwight Lightning!
",44,3,12
"9618","Cubert: Very well. But I get to name the next strategy.
",44,3,12
"9619","Announcer: [on TV] This week on The Real World: The Sun.
",44,3,12
"9620","Man: [on TV] I'm burning to death!
",44,3,12
"9621","Leela: You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
",44,3,12
"9622","Hermes: People, as you know, our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us.
",44,3,12
"9623","Bender: [simultaneous] Alright!
",44,3,12
"9624","Fry: [simultaneous] That's great!
",44,3,12
"9625","Leela: [simultaneous] That's good!
",44,3,12
"9626","Hermes: Naturally, we're humiliated.
",44,3,12
"9627","Farnsworth: That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable.
",44,3,12
"9628","Hermes: We'll start by slashing salaries, and this time I mean really slashing.
",44,3,12
"9629","Leela: Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly.
",44,3,12
"9630","Fry: We don't work for you anymore!
",44,3,12
"9631","Farnsworth: What?
",44,3,12
"9632","Leela: Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
",44,3,12
"9633","Cubert: Incoming! We got papers to stuff, team! Hup two, hup two!
",44,3,12
"9634","Fry: Yes, sir.
",44,3,12
"9635","Bender: Right away!
",44,3,12
"9636","Leela: We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth.
",44,3,12
"9637","Farnsworth: Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!
",44,3,12
"9638","Hermes: I don't even know who this guy is!
",44,3,12
"9639","Scruffy: I'm Scruffy, the janitor.
",44,3,12
"9640","Farnsworth: Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express.
",44,3,12
"9641","Scruffy: I'm on break.
",44,3,12
"9642","Cubert: Sorry to interrupt this whirlwind of activity but we have an announcement.
",44,3,12
"9643","Dwight: I direct your attention to these forms, which I'm presently engaged in handing to you.
",44,3,12
"9644","Hermes: Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
",44,3,12
"9645","Farnsworth: Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
",44,3,12
"9646","Dwight: No. But you did declare yourself dead three years ago as a tax dodge.
",44,3,12
"9647","Farnsworth: Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park and they start declaring you this and that.
",44,3,12
"9648","Cubert: Either way, I technically inherit your building and your spaceship, which means Planet Express is now ... [He presses a button and an Awesome Express banner falls over the Planet Express logo on the screen.] ... Awesome Express!
",44,3,12
"9649","Hermes: [angry] You rotten kids! [nice] Will you be hiring?
",44,3,12
"9650","Dwight: No.
",44,3,12
"9651","Hermes: [angry] You rotten kids!
",44,3,12
"9652","Fry: There. One million papers, folded and loaded!
",44,3,12
"9653","Cubert: Hey, Leela, help me apply these flame decals I got in my cereal. They'll make the ship go faster.
",44,3,12
"9654","Leela: And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
",44,3,12
"9655","Cubert: I'm 12.
",44,3,12
"9656","Farnsworth: Oh, did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?
",44,3,12
"9657","Zoidberg: There but for the grace of God.
",44,3,12
"9658","Bender: [singing] Hush, little brewski,
Don't you leak,
Daddy wants to drink for at least a week.[He rumbles.] (talking) Oh, my God! I think it's time!
",44,3,12
"9659","Fry: Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs.
",44,3,12
"9660","Fry: Push, Bender, push!
",44,3,12
"9661","Leela: You're doing great!
",44,3,12
"9662","Bender: It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me.
",44,3,12
"9663","Fry: Almost there. Just two more bottles.
",44,3,12
"9664","Bender: Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
",44,3,12
"9665","Fry: It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!
",44,3,12
"9666","Dwight: Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery company not a delivery room!
",44,3,12
"9667","Cubert: We just busted our bums delivering a million papers and this is how you greet us, with a bunch of frosty, cold beers?
",44,3,12
"9668","Fry: Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?
",44,3,12
"9669","Cubert: Uh ... we just did, OK? 'Cause we're awesome! Yeah! Awesome.
",44,3,12
"9670","Dwight: Yeah, awesome!
",44,3,12
"9671","Leela: Hello, Awesome Express; the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? What's that? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long?
",44,3,12
"9672","Farnsworth: Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer? [LaBarbara scoffs.] Please?
",44,3,12
"9673","LaBarbara: Don't you sweet talk me, you wrinkly, old tube sack!
",44,3,12
"9674","Hermes: Might I have one too, wife?
",44,3,12
"9675","LaBarbara: Oh, you're both pathetic, being jealous of your own offspring. Now you should be happy they became successes, instead of following in your foot stamps.
",44,3,12
"9676","Hermes: Oh, it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being better than them.
",44,3,12
"9677","Farnsworth: They're so stinking talented, they don't even need their fathers anymore.
",44,3,12
"9678","Cubert: Dad! We screwed up!
",44,3,12
"9679","Farnsworth: You did? Tough luck, suckers!
",44,3,12
"9680","Dwight: Please, help us, Pops. We agreed to deliver way more papers than we can handle.
",44,3,12
"9681","Cubert: [crying] But we couldn't handle them, so we started dumping the extras in a crater on the Moon.
",44,3,12
"9682","Dwight: [crying] And now everyone's yelling at us about our missing papers!
",44,3,12
"9683","Cubert: [crying] And we don't know what to do!
",44,3,12
"9684","Farnsworth: Why did you boys do all this?
",44,3,12
"9685","Dwight: [crying] We just wanted you to be proud of us.
",44,3,12
"9686","Hermes: Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency. Of course we're proud of you!
",44,3,12
"9687","Farnsworth: Damn right we are! Now come on, let's go do a little father-son weaselling out of this.
",44,3,12
"9688","Farnsworth: [from ship] Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes.
",44,3,12
"9689","Hermes: OK, boys, let me show you how a paper man does it.
",44,3,12
"9690","Little Prince: Au revoir!
",44,3,12
"9691","Dwight: Can I use the gun, Dad?
",44,3,12
"9692","Hermes: Aw, what kind of father would I be if I said no?
",44,3,12
"9693","Dwight: Only one house to go. We did it! [They cheer. The screen beeps and displays the Blob house. Inside, Bret Blob lifts weights.] Run away! That bully, Bret Blob, lives there!
",44,3,12
"9694","Cubert: He's ugly mean stupid stink mucus! And last week we sort of ... broke his window.
",44,3,12
"9695","Hermes: Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?
",44,3,12
"9696","Dwight: [sheepish] Pay for it?
",44,3,12
"9697","Hermes: Oh, heavens, no! We apologise, with nice, cheap words!
",44,3,12
"9698","Bret: I thought I heard the doorbell but I see it was the dorkbell!
",44,3,12
"9699","Dwight: Man, you're funny. Good one, Bret.
",44,3,12
"9700","Farnsworth: Now, now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy.
",44,3,12
"9701","Bret: Whatever. [shouting] Dad!
",44,3,12
"9702","Hermes: Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal, reasonable man.
",44,3,12
"9703","Horrible Gelatinous Blob: What the hell do you want?
",44,3,12
"9704","Farnsworth: Mr. Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends.
",44,3,12
"9705","Cubert: Sorry, sir.
",44,3,12
"9706","Dwight: Yeah, sorry.
",44,3,12
"9707","Horrible Gelatinous Blob: You can shove your apology into the bottom of your one-way digestive system.
",44,3,12
"9708","Farnsworth: Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
",44,3,12
"9709","Horrible Gelatinous Blob: Aww. Tell you what, I'll accept their apology when they kiss my ass! Which I don't have!
",44,3,12
"9710","Farnsworth: No one gives my boy that option!
",44,3,12
"9711","Hermes: Bring it on, Jello-pop!
",44,3,12
"9712","Cubert: Yeah, get him, Dad!
",44,3,12

"9714","Cubert: Right.
",44,3,12
"9715","Cubert: That was incredible! You are the bravest dads in the entire trauma centre!
",44,3,12
"9716","Dwight: You guys almost had him ... until he digested you.
",44,3,12
"9717","Hermes: Oh, you're good kids. [He coughs.] If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride. [Cubert and Dwight hug their dads, making them scream.] I was wrong! I can still feel pain!
",44,3,12
"9718","Farnsworth: He's come to finish the job! Someone toss me out the window!
",44,3,12
"9719","Horrible Gelatinous Blob: No, no, wait. I-I feel terrible about what happened. I-I've just been under a lot of stress lately down at the plant, y'know. They're-They're bringing in computers to ""improve productivity"" and, well, that's no excuse for how I acted. But the boy needs to see that real men solve their disagreements with words, not violence, so, uh, if you'll accept my apology, well, I hope we can put this embarrassing incident behind us.
",44,3,12
"9720","Farnsworth: I suppose.
",44,3,12
"9721","Bender: Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies.
",44,3,12
"9722","Hermes: Oh, why not? Might as well live it up as long as I've got this catheter in me!
",44,3,12
"9723","Farnsworth: Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?
",44,3,12
"9724","Horrible Gelatinous Blob: Sounds like a plan!
",44,3,12
"9725","Hermes: This is what makes life worth clinging to; three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons.
",44,3,12
"9726","Farnsworth: It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it's what's inside that counts.
",44,3,12
"9727","Bender: [singing] Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh
Well, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride,
Blah, blah, blah, something, Bender is great!
Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh--
",45,3,13
"9728","Fry: Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time! [He opens the packet and Bender eats one. Something clangs around inside of him and he shits a brick. Then some.] There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there.
",45,3,13
"9729","Bender: What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
",45,3,13
"9730","Fry: No, it's an old Volkswagen van. [He wipes the window clean and sees some hippie skeletons inside.] [shouting] Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?
",45,3,13
"9731","Sal: [shouting] Sure. You wanna dump the corpses out of theres, it's yourses.
",45,3,13
"9732","Fry: Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before.
",45,3,13
"9733","Leela: What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
",45,3,13
"9734","Fry: It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!
",45,3,13
"9735","Amy: Wow, neat.
",45,3,13
"9736","Hermes: It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
",45,3,13
"9737","Amy: Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?
",45,3,13
"9738","Fry: No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound.
",45,3,13
"9739","Farnsworth: Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
",45,3,13
"9740","Fry: Under the seat.
",45,3,13
"9741","Leela: Why won't it start?
",45,3,13
"9742","Fry: It just needs some gas.
",45,3,13
"9743","Farnsworth: Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.
",45,3,13
"9744","Leela: Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels.
",45,3,13
"9745","Fry: Like what?
",45,3,13
"9746","Leela: Whale oil. [She points to a barrel of Mobil Dick Whale Oil.] Bender, lift it up to the can opener.
",45,3,13
"9747","Bender: Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off.
",45,3,13
"9748","Fry: Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs.
",45,3,13
"9749","Bender: What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
",45,3,13
"9750","Fry: Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that.
",45,3,13
"9751","Bender: OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans.
",45,3,13
"9752","Leela: Come on!
",45,3,13
"9753","Hermes: You can do it!
",45,3,13
"9754","Amy: Bender!
",45,3,13
"9755","Farnsworth: Go on, you dummy.
",45,3,13
"9756","Bender: [singing] Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,[He screams in pain.]
Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
",45,3,13
"9757","Fry: Oh, no!
",45,3,13
"9758","Bender: [singing] Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,
Cause the master's gone away.
",45,3,13
"9759","Zoidberg: [tapping his feet] It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
",45,3,13
"9760","Bender: Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?
",45,3,13
"9761","Doctor: This is the worst part of the job.
",45,3,13
"9762","Bender: What is it, good news?
",45,3,13
"9763","Doctor: Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll never move again.
",45,3,13
"9764","Bender: You mean--
",45,3,13
"9765","Doctor: I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new one.
",45,3,13
"9766","Fry: Oh, no! This is terrible.
",45,3,13
"9767","Zoidberg: Poor Bender.
",45,3,13
"9768","Farnsworth: Well, let's drag him to the kerb.
",45,3,13
"9769","Fry: Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes.
",45,3,13
"9770","Bender: [crying] Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again.
",45,3,13
"9771","Robot: Ho, ho! Hello there!
",45,3,13
"9772","Leela: Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter.
",45,3,13
"9773","Patch Cord Adams: Come on, take it. What's the matter, can't move your arms?
",45,3,13
"9774","Bender: Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now.
",45,3,13
"9775","Patch Cord Adams: Hey, here's a giggle! [He plugs himself into a Jokebook Computer and downloads some jokes.] Did you hear why they're using Windows 3000 as a prison guard?
",45,3,13
"9776","Fry: No, why?
",45,3,13
"9777","Patch Cord Adams: 'Cause it always locks up.
",45,3,13
"9778","Bender: For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!
",45,3,13
"9779","Patch Cord Adams: Well, so long. Get well soon. [He looks at Bender's medical notes.] Oh, well, so long anyway.
",45,3,13
"9780","Bender: Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way.
",45,3,13
"9781","Fry: Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?
",45,3,13
"9782","Bender: Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up. [The doctor draws back the curtain and reveals the head in a jar of Beck. Beck wears a futuristic harmonica holder around his neck with little arms that move the harmonica back and forth in front of his mouth. The doctor pulls a mask over his face and welds Beck's jar to the neck of a life-sized dummy. Beck stops playing.] Wow, that was great.
",45,3,13
"9783","Beck: Hey, thanks. You a fan?
",45,3,13
"9784","Bender: I dunno. Let me see. [He focuses his eyes and sees Beck's nameplate.] Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me.
",45,3,13
"9785","Beck: Don't take it so hard. I used to miss my body too but then I fished this mannequin out of the 92c Store dumpster.
",45,3,13
"9786","Bender: Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you.
",45,3,13
"9787","Beck: So do it, robot. It's easier than it looks.
",45,3,13
"9788","Bender: Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now.
",45,3,13
"9789","Beck: Or maybe you'll be the best musician ever.
",45,3,13
"9790","Bender: What's this for?
",45,3,13
"9791","Beck: Try and scrape it across your chest like a knife on burnt toast. [Bender struggles and strains as he tries to move the little arms on the harmonica holder.] Come on, move those arms. Use the power of mental thinking. Make it dynamic. [Bender starts moving the arms with ease and scrapes them across his scarred chest.] Yeah-ee! Alright, congratulations, my friend.
",45,3,13
"9792","Bender: Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
",45,3,13
"9793","Beck: Exactly. I use those all the time in my music. Bender, I want you to become my new washboard player.
",45,3,13
"9794","Bender: Alright! [He does a happy dance with the little arms.] Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
",45,3,13
"9795","Bender: Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues.
",45,3,13
"9796","Hermes: Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true.
",45,3,13
"9797","Fry: Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?
",45,3,13
"9798","Zoidberg: Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van.
",45,3,13
"9799","Beck: [shouting] Come on, move it! We gotta get to the concert and make the audience wait for it at the start.
",45,3,13
"9800","Zoidberg: Bad news, friends. My shell ran.
",45,3,13
"9801","Amy: Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's--
",45,3,13
"9802","Leela: Kinda cool.
",45,3,13
"9803","Fry: Yeah, I like it.
",45,3,13
"9804","Amy: Me too, now that I'm used to it.
",45,3,13
"9805","Zoidberg: Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!
",45,3,13
"9806","Beck: [singing] There's a destination a little up the road,
From the habitations and the towns we know,
A place we saw the lights turn low,
The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh glow,
Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts,
Two turntables and a microphone,
Bottles and cans just clap your hands,
Just clap your hands.
",45,3,13
"9807","All: [singing] Where it's at!
",45,3,13
"9808","Bender: [electric voice] Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
",45,3,13
"9809","Beck: That was a washboard break.
",45,3,13
"9810","Fry: Oh, yeah!
",45,3,13
"9811","Amy: Yeah! [She turns around to the bar.] One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please.
",45,3,13
"9812","Barman: That'll be three pick-e-tures of George Washington.
",45,3,13
"9813","Amy: Oh, no! My beautiful money.
",45,3,13
"9814","Leela: It got ruined in the wash.
",45,3,13
"9815","Fry: Mine too, even my change.
",45,3,13
"9816","Barman: Get lost, you money-less hippies!
",45,3,13
"9817","Horrible Gelatinous Hick: You heard him, freaks. We don't like your type around here. These are the types we like.
",45,3,13
"9818","Beck: Bender, that was the best 40-minute washboard solo I've ever heard. And the parts when I was awake blew my mind.
",45,3,13
"9819","Bender: Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!
",45,3,13
"9820","Robot #1: I don't believe my broken eyes! It's Bender, the washboard player! Hey, man, we caught your concert from here.
",45,3,13
"9821","Robot #2: You rock!
",45,3,13
"9822","Fembot: Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest! It's in that bin behind me.
",45,3,13
"9823","Robot #3: Yo, brother, thanks for showing that broken robots are still useful.
",45,3,13
"9824","Bender: Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be-- [He is interrupted by the sound of machinery in a building grinding up the robots and turning them into paperweights.] That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass.
",45,3,13
"9825","Beck: Whoa, dog. Just cold chill. [A woman moves him closer to Bender.] You know, when I'm upset, I write a song about it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, I was feeling really-- What's that song about?
",45,3,13
"9826","Bender: Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like ""odelay"".
",45,3,13
"9827","Beck: ""Odelay"" is a word. Just look it up in the Becktionary.
",45,3,13
"9828","Bender: Ooh!
",45,3,13
"9829","Bender: I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary. [A man offers him the book.] No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.
",45,3,13
"9830","Beck: I wish I could help raise awareness about broken robots. But what can I do? I only weigh eight pounds.
",45,3,13
"9831","Bender: Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!
",45,3,13
"9832","Beck: We can all get together for a big benefit concert in San Francisco!
",45,3,13
"9833","Bender: And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!
",45,3,13
"9834","Beck: And you can sing that song you're writing!
",45,3,13
"9835","Bender: And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me: Bender.
",45,3,13
"9836","Bender: Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and ... finished! [He sniffs.] Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!
",45,3,13
"9837","Fry: Surprise!
",45,3,13
"9838","Leela: Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
",45,3,13
"9839","Bender: Alright, but hands off the minibar.
",45,3,13
"9840","Fry: Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on.
",45,3,13
"9841","Announcer #1: [voice-over; on TV] Tuesday, Golden Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely-folkish alterna-rock will strum your brains out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing Fungus and special guest, Bender!

"9842","Announcer #2: [voice-over; on TV] A portion of the proceeds might go to help broken robots.

",45,3,13
"9845","Amy: Bender, you're famous!
",45,3,13
"9846","Bender: Yeah.
",45,3,13
"9847","Leela: This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?
",45,3,13
"9848","Bender: [crying] Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now: I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilised. [He stops crying and stands up.] That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!"".
",45,3,13
"9849","Fry: Bender, you can move! You're cured!
",45,3,13
"9850","Bender: Oh, crap! It's a miracle!
",45,3,13
"9851","Bender: I can move again. [crying] My music career is over.
",45,3,13
"9852","Fry: Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?
",45,3,13
"9853","Bender: [crying] No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. [He gasps and stops crying.] Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!
",45,3,13
"9854","Amy: You'd better not do that at the concert.
",45,3,13
"9855","Zoidberg: I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat.
",45,3,13
"9856","Amy: You are so disgusting, I--

",45,3,13

",45,3,13
"9883","Garfunkel: Bender, to start your foundation for broken robots, here's a big, cardboard cheque for $14,000.

I still don't care,

"9963","Hermes: Go get it, boy!
",46,3,14
"9964","Fry: So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them.
",46,3,14
"9965","Leela: Those aren't swan boats, they're swans.
",46,3,14

",46,3,14

",46,3,14
"9968","Tate: Pitiful ballplayers of Earth, I am Ethan ""Bubblegum"" Tate, commander of the Harlem Globetrotters. [The crowd gasps.] For generations, your puny planet has lived in peace with the Globetrotter Homeworld. But now, for no reason, we challenge you to defend your honour on the basketball court. [The crowd murmurs.] Will no one meet our challenge? Have none of you pathetic Earthlings game?
",46,3,14
"9969","Fry: [shouting] What happens if we lose?
",46,3,14
"9970","Tate: Nothing. There's nothing at stake and no threat, beyond the shame of defeat!
",46,3,14

"9972","Tate: You, old man? Sweet Clyde, laugh derisively at him.
",46,3,14
"9973","Farnsworth: I may be an old man. In fact, I'm fairly sure I am. But I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!
",46,3,14

",46,3,14
"9975","Farnsworth: Behold: My mutant atomic supermen.
",46,3,14
"9976","Leela: They're only a foot high, Professor.
",46,3,14
"9977","Farnsworth: Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons.
",46,3,14
"9978","Bender: Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--
",46,3,14
"9979","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! You're off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons.
",46,3,14
"9980","Fry: Hey, Leela, look at me!
",46,3,14
"9981","Leela: Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
",46,3,14
"9982","Fry: There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
",46,3,14
"9983","Leela: Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot.
",46,3,14
"9984","Fry: C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there.
",46,3,14
"9985","Leela: No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face.
",46,3,14
"9986","Bender: [shouting] Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!
",46,3,14
"9987","Leela: Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
",46,3,14
"9988","Farnsworth: None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker. [He screws a cap onto the bottle and puts it on the side of the cage. The supermen drink the particles and start to grow. One grows extremely tall, another grows an extra three arms, another grows a cannon in the middle of his chest, another turns into a spider and another gets radioactive eyes.] Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.

"9990","Arachneon: [sexfully] Hello!
",46,3,14
"9991","Albert: Marv Albert here at Madison Cube Garden where the Harlem Globetrotters take on a squad of atomic supermen in what promises to be a by-the-numbers athletic contest with no surprises whatsoever. [The referee blows the whistle and the game begins.] Here's the tip-off. Globetrotter ball. Sweet Clyde Dixon to Bubblegum Tate. Drives down-court-- And Curly Joe from the rear.
",46,3,14
"9992","Zoidberg: That one grabbed his behindus!
",46,3,14
"9993","Leela: Sh!
",46,3,14
"9994","Hermes: Quiet!
",46,3,14
"9995","Tate: Who dares laugh at the Jesters of Dunk? We came to terrify and humiliate you, not tickle your funnybones. Watch as I embarrass your civilisation by passing the ball to Curly Joe. [He throws the ball and Thorias jumps for it but it springs back into Tate's hand.] Only to have it remain in my hands with elastic. [He laughs and the crowd ""boos"".] And perhaps this will wipe the smiles from your faces.
",46,3,14
"9996","Albert: Goosh goes up. [Armo grabs it.] Rejected! Grotrian from half-court. [He scores.] Yes!
",46,3,14
"9997","Albert: Supermen lead 45-42. Arachneon with the steal, to Thorias. Thorias from downtown! [Thorias puts the ball into his cannon and blasts it into the net.] Yes! He's really showing us what a man with a cannon in his chest can do!
",46,3,14
"9998","Farnsworth: No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!
",46,3,14
"9999","Albert: And that's the half, with the Supermen up 48-42. Surprisingly dull, so far. [Arachneon drinks some water and signs some autographs for some kids.] Bubblegum, the Trotters are down by six. Reactions?
",46,3,14
"10000","Tate: It was always our plan to trail at the half, thus deepening Earth's eventual humiliation. Also, what game were the refs watching?
",46,3,14
"10001","Albert: Curly Joe, easily amused by his own antics ... [Curly Joe slides down Grotrian's arms onto the court.] ... continues to wreak havoc on--
",46,3,14
"10002","Farnsworth: What the-- [The crowd mumbles.] Did everything just jump around, or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?
",46,3,14
"10003","Albert: Ladies and gentlemen, something very strange has just happened in this basketball game between space clowns and atomic monsters.
",46,3,14
"10004","Farnsworth: Time-out! Time-out!
",46,3,14
"10005","Fry: What's happening?
",46,3,14
"10006","Farnsworth: We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player.
",46,3,14
"10007","Amy: What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
",46,3,14
"10008","Farnsworth: No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
",46,3,14
"10009","Thorias: Oops!
",46,3,14
"10010","Farnsworth: Oh, great! Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man.
",46,3,14
"10011","Fry: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Put me in, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills.
",46,3,14
"10012","Farnsworth: Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
",46,3,14
"10013","Fry: Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly--
",46,3,14
"10014","Albert: Globetrotters win, 244-86. A dark day for humanity, folks. We have been beaten ... in basketball.
",46,3,14
"10015","Curly Joe: Yeah, that's how we do it!
",46,3,14
"10016","'Sweet' Clyde: How's that?
",46,3,14
"10017","Tate: You are all fools of the highest calibre.
",46,3,14
"10018","Leela: I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
",46,3,14
"10019","Hermes: I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
",46,3,14
"10020","Farnsworth: Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious.
",46,3,14
"10021","Tate: Damn right, brother man. This chronological wang-dang-doodle could destroy the very matrix of reality.
",46,3,14
"10022","Farnsworth: Tate? What do you know about this?
",46,3,14
"10023","Tate: Not much, yet. But I am senior lecturer of physics at Globetrotter U. And I'd like to help you investigate.
",46,3,14
"10024","Farnsworth: You're that Bubblegum Tate?
",46,3,14
"10025","Tate: Well I sure ain't his grandma. Now look here, Prof. [He draws some diagrams on a board.] I think we got ourselves an excess of Chronitons in the subatomic interstices.
",46,3,14
"10026","Farnsworth: Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself.
",46,3,14
"10027","Fry: Is that a problem?
",46,3,14
"10028","Farnsworth: Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; by Wednesday, it will be August; and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it.

"10030","Linda: [on TV] Time continues to skip forward randomly. Details at 11.
",46,3,14
"10031","Linda: [on TV] This is the news at 11. The mysterious and unexplained--
",46,3,14
"10032","Linda: [on TV] Turning to entertainment news, teen singer Wendy might just be the latest--

"10033","Linda: [on TV] --won three Grammys last night--
",46,3,14
"10034","Linda: [on TV] --found dead in her bathtub.
",46,3,14
"10035","Farnsworth: Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it.
",46,3,14
"10036","Fry: You mean we just--
",46,3,14
"10037","Farnsworth: My, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck, Bubblegum?
",46,3,14
"10038","Tate: Not yet. Listen, I hope you don't mind if I dribble a little while I work.
",46,3,14
"10039","Farnsworth: Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
",46,3,14
"10040","Bender: Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?
",46,3,14
"10041","Tate: Shut up, turkey.
",46,3,14
"10042","Farnsworth: Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly.
",46,3,14
"10043","Tate: Good Lord! That sucker's shaking around like some fine, imported booty.
",46,3,14
"10044","Hermes: Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just--
",46,3,14
"10045","Hermes: I don't know how this was suppose to work.

",46,3,14
"10051","Fry: Psst! Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with.
",46,3,14
"10052","Leela: Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see.
",46,3,14
"10053","Leela: How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
",46,3,14
"10054","Fry: [sexfully] Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still.
",46,3,14
"10055","Fry: Ow!

",46,3,14
"10060","Zoidberg: Sorry, you must have been boring me.
",46,3,14
"10061","Leela: The thing is, Fry is very sweet, but he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness.
",46,3,14
"10062","Zoidberg: So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg! [He cries then suddenly stops.] You were saying?
",46,3,14
"10063","Farnsworth: Ah, there is it. The Tempus Nebula. Take a whiff through the Smellescope.
",46,3,14
"10064","Tate: What's that funky jazz?
",46,3,14
"10065","Farnsworth: The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe.
",46,3,14
"10066","Bender: Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
",46,3,14
"10067","Tate: Pretend these basketballs are time particles, my silver honky. As the nebula bounce-passes them off us ... [He throws the balls at Bender and they dent his head.] ... they cause these dents, or ""time skips"".

",46,3,14
"10069","Tate: Hold up. What if we were to move this cluster of starts to these algebraic co-ordinates?
",46,3,14
"10070","Farnsworth: Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
",46,3,14
"10071","Tate: Yeah. But is it possible? Moving stars would require one bad-ass gravity pump. And we'd need all the money on Earth to--

"10073","Farnsworth: Wha?
",46,3,14

",46,3,14
"10076","Farnsworth: Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. [The gravity pump is huge and has a basketball on the end.] Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th--

",46,3,14
"10080","Tate: [from ship] Nothing but nebula!

",46,3,14
"10088","Leela: Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?
",46,3,14
"10089","Fry: You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are.

"10095","Fry: I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?

",46,3,14
"10113","Leela: How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
",46,3,14
"10114","Fry: No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--

"10135","Farnsworth: Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?
",46,3,14
"10136","Curly Joe: No, man. An explosion big enough to destroy that mama would take out half the universe.

"10137","Sweet Clyde: You gotta Globetrotter that explosion up a little, Farnsy. Make it an implosion.
",46,3,14
"10138","Farnsworth: By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping.
",46,3,14
"10139","Tate: Whoa. Slow that brain train down, Prof. We'd need some kind of doomsday device to initiate an implosion like that.

",46,3,14
"10164","Leela: I guess not.
",46,3,14

",47,3,15

",47,3,15
"10330","Liubot #2: [mechanical voice] I am Lucy Liu. Give me your spines.

",47,3,15
"10334","Leela: Alright, Liu. Time to kick your frosty, well-toned ass! Yah!
",47,3,15
"10335","Bender: Then along came Bender.
",47,3,15
"10336","Zoidberg: Looks like you're retaining water.
",47,3,15
"10337","Liu: That was incredible, Bender. You're like Jackie Chan before he got all doughy.
",47,3,15
"10338","Bender: Oh, shucks! I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior! [He screams. A crowd of Liubots march towards them.] It's an army of Lucy Lius!
",47,3,15
"10339","Liu: They're horrible!
",47,3,15
"10340","Liubots: [mechanical voices] Take this and that and one of these.
",47,3,15
"10341","Liubot #3: [mechanical voice] Robot crouching tiger.
",47,3,15

",47,3,15
"10343","Zapp: Now that's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes!
",47,3,15
"10344","Liubot #5: [mechanical voice] Hi-yah.
",47,3,15
"10345","Fry: This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
",47,3,15
"10346","Liubot: It's amazing the way you [mechanical voice] notice two things.
",47,3,15
"10347","Alex: [in movie] No, don't open that coffin! It's ticking!
",47,3,15
"10348","Natalie: [in movie] I have to, Alex. That coffin's not going to open itself.
",47,3,15
"10349","Vampire: [in movie] Bleurh!
",47,3,15
"10350","Liu: Let's hide in here. It'll add to my box office gross.
",47,3,15
"10351","Leela: Fry?
",47,3,15
"10352","Fry: Aw, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet. [He notices Liu and gasps.] Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?
",47,3,15
"10353","Liu: Read the jar, Evelyn Wood! Dr. Z?
",47,3,15
"10354","Leela: Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?
",47,3,15
"10355","Fry: Let me see. [He kisses her.] Yep. Why do you ask?
",47,3,15
"10356","Alex: [in movie] Mr. Mayor, if you want to see a real vampire, look in the mirror!
",47,3,15
"10357","Mayor: [in movie] I can't! I'm a vampire!
",47,3,15
"10358","Zoidberg: Why?
",47,3,15
"10359","Leela: And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
",47,3,15
"10360","Fry: [shouting] Quick! This way!
",47,3,15
"10361","Fry: Sorry, ladies. Employees only.
",47,3,15
"10362","Leela: Oh, no. They're forming a human pyramid ... of robots.
",47,3,15
"10363","Bender: Damnit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
",47,3,15
"10364","Liu: A dangerous mistake to make.
",47,3,15
"10365","Zoidberg: At least we've got food.
",47,3,15
"10366","Leela: Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag!
",47,3,15

",47,3,15
"10374","Bender: You'll be safe in here, sweetheart. [He opens his chest cabinet and takes out another head.] Get lost, Pavarotti!
",47,3,15
"10375","Fry: Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn, I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot.
",47,3,15

",47,3,15
"10377","Fry: What are you doing, darling? Get down!
",47,3,15
"10378","Liubot #3: [mechanical voice] Light hot. Oil temperature rising.
",47,3,15

",47,3,15
"10380","Liubot #5: [mechanical voice] Malfunction.

",47,3,15
"10384","Liubot: Yes, my love. I'll be just [mechanical voice] massive corn clog in port seven.
",47,3,15
"10385","Liu: Are you the last copy of me?
",47,3,15
"10386","Liubot: Yes.
",47,3,15
"10387","Liu: Erase her, Fry.
",47,3,15
"10388","Fry: What? No!
",47,3,15
"10389","Liu: Fry, when you downloaded her without my permission, you stole my image, and in the end that's all I really have. That and the largest gold nugget in the world, one mile in diameter.
",47,3,15
"10390","Fry: But I just downloaded her because I love you.
",47,3,15
"10391","Liu: If you love the real Lucy Liu and not just what you've seen in movies, genre-straddling lawyer shows and kiss-ass articles in People magazine, you'll blank out that robot.
",47,3,15
"10392","Fry: I'm sorry. Hug me, Liubot.
",47,3,15
"10393","Liubot: I'll always remember you, Fry-- [mechanical voice] Memory deleted.
",47,3,15
"10394","Bender: I know it hurts, buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore.
",47,3,15
"10395","Fry: Uh-huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
",47,3,15
"10396","Bender: Pft! Yeah, at our wedding!
",47,3,15
"10397","Liu: It's true. Bender and I are in love.
",47,3,15

",47,3,15
"10399","Bender: Don't be a prude, Fry!
",47,3,15
"10400","Leela: Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
",48,3,16
"10401","Fry: I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure.
",48,3,16
"10402","Leela: That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. [He hands them to her and she snaps it in half and looks through it like a telescope. Across the street an alien opens up Family Bros. Pizza.] I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
",48,3,16
"10403","Farnsworth: Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
",48,3,16
"10404","Leela: Professor, please! Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
",48,3,16
"10405","Farnsworth: No!
",48,3,16
"10406","Blek: You sure about these chairs? Guidebook says human legs bend down at knee.
",48,3,16
"10407","Blek: It's OK, Mama. Anyone complains, I bend legs up for free. [He sees Fry, Bender and Leela through the window.] Ooh! Customers! [Enter the trio.] Welcome to Earth pizza store. Here, sit. I bend knees for you.
",48,3,16
"10408","Bender: Ooh! That's a-comfy!
",48,3,16
"10409","Blek: OK, now, what kind of pizza goes in you? [He points to a topping menu that offers silt, asbestos, flaming magnesium, stucco, scarab and guano.] Silt? Asbestos? We got guano -- very fresh!
",48,3,16
"10410","Fry: Uh ... hmm ... do you have any food?
",48,3,16
"10411","Blek: Here, try a deep dish pizza. [He puts a pizza topped with slop on the table.] Contains four kind of things.
",48,3,16
"10412","Leela: I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit.
",48,3,16
"10413","Cygnoid Woman: [happy] Thank you.
",48,3,16
"10414","Leela: No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
",48,3,16
"10415","Fry: Hey, hey. What's wrong? Was it something Leela said?
",48,3,16
"10416","Cygnoid Woman: [crying] We come to Earth to start new life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, live Earthican dream.
",48,3,16
"10417","Fry: Aw. Don't cry, foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza, Earth style!
",48,3,16
"10418","Cygnoid Woman: Oh, thank you, magic biped!
",48,3,16
"10419","Blek: You save us, a-sir. If we cannot make Earth pizza our dream will die. Just like rats we crushed to make the wine.
",48,3,16
"10420","Fry: For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point: No more live bees. [He holds up a jar of live bees.] Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them.
",48,3,16
"10421","Cygnoid #2: Hey, ocupado!
",48,3,16
"10422","Fry: Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other. [He turns the TV on and there is a blernsball game on.] Ah, the Earthican pastime: Blernsball!
",48,3,16
"10423","Uecker: [on TV] Mulligan drives the ball. It's going, going and caught by the shortstop. Mets lose again. Man, I haven't seen play this bad since the days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker saying thanks for watching!
",48,3,16
"10424","Blek: Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? I don't understand this ""blernsball"".
",48,3,16
"10425","Fry: Well, if you're going to be Earthicans, we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh, but you'll need nine players.
",48,3,16
"10426","Cygnoid Woman: No problem!
",48,3,16
"10427","Cygnoid #2: Play the ball!
",48,3,16
"10428","Farnsworth: [shouting] Go, team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!
",48,3,16
"10429","Blek: Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful star-brightened day, friendly blernsball game with chum pals! So pleasant for everybody.
",48,3,16
"10430","Scruffy: Hit by a pitch. Take your base.
",48,3,16
"10431","Leela: [shouting] Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
",48,3,16
"10432","Bender: No batter! No batter! [Leela pitches and knocks the second Cygnoid over.] No batter anymore.
",48,3,16
"10433","Scruffy: Take your base.
",48,3,16
"10434","Leela: [shouting] I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception.
",48,3,16
"10435","Cygnoid #2: Yeah, me too now.
",48,3,16
"10436","Bender: Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter! [The ball hits the Cygnoid.] Duck!
",48,3,16
"10437","Scruffy: Take your base.
",48,3,16
"10438","Cygnoid #3: Please, lady, I want to live. Can I use bat to protect head?
",48,3,16
"10439","Bender: Apparently not.
",48,3,16
"10440","Man: Check out the one-eyed bean machine!
",48,3,16
"10441","Blek: Hooray! I make a score point!
",48,3,16
"10442","Fry: Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch.
",48,3,16
"10443","Leela: But I've got a no-hitter going. [She sighs.] You're right. Here.
",48,3,16
"10444","Randy: Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!
",48,3,16
"10445","Doubledeal: Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you.
",48,3,16
"10446","Leela: Am I under arrest?
",48,3,16
"10447","Bender: Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
",48,3,16
"10448","Doubledeal: Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who owns the New New York Mets.
",48,3,16
"10449","Leela: The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
",48,3,16
"10450","Doubledeal: Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd like you. Which is why I wanna sign you to the team.
",48,3,16
"10451","Leela: You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball?
",48,3,16
"10452","Commissioner: Well, yeah, but basically you'd just be a publicity stunt. I figure a one-eyed lady skull-buster might bring out the freakshow crowd.
",48,3,16
"10453","Leela: Wow! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball.
",48,3,16
"10454","Commissioner: Again, yeah, but basically you'd just be--
",48,3,16
"10455","Leela: Ta-da! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball. How do I look?
",48,3,16
"10456","Hermes: Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
",48,3,16
"10457","Farnsworth: Why is your number seven-eighth's?
",48,3,16
"10458","Leela: All the whole numbers have been retired.
",48,3,16
"10459","Fry: Wow! I must say, I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?
",48,3,16
"10460","Leela: Fry, I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead.
",48,3,16
"10461","Fry: Oh! Now I'm too nervous.
",48,3,16
"10462","Uecker: Well, folks, it's only the fifth inning but the Swedes have already turned this one into a ""laffer"". And that's with two F's. The crowd is pouring out of the stadium L.A.-style.
",48,3,16
"10463","Doubledeal: Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put it our new novelty act: Leela.
",48,3,16
"10464","Skipper: Darn it! I already put in the circus clown.
",48,3,16
"10465","Doubledeal: Yeah, but he bunted. Clowns are only funny when they swing away.
",48,3,16
"10466","Announcer: [on loudspeaker] Your attention, please. Now pitching for the Mets: Turanga Leela. [Leela walks out onto the pitch but the crowd doesn't notice.] A one-eyed woman.

",48,3,16
"10468","Fry: [shouting] Go, Leela!
",48,3,16
"10469","Bender: [shouting] Come on, girl!
",48,3,16
"10470","Amy: [shouting] Too much eyeliner!
",48,3,16
"10471","Uecker: This is history in the making, folks. Bjornson steps up to the plate and Leela delivers.
",48,3,16
"10472","Bender: Bullseye!
",48,3,16
"10473","Uecker: Ooh! An inauspicious start for the career of the first woman blernsballer. [Another batter steps up and Leela beans him. The crowd gasps again.] An inauspicious continuation for the career of the first woman blernsballer.
",48,3,16
"10474","Crowd: [chanting] Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!
",48,3,16
"10475","Uecker: Ouch! It's a three-bean-ball salad. The Mets fans love it though, and who can blame them? They haven't had much to cheer about this year--
",48,3,16
"10476","Doubledeal: Kid, that was great! You got us more publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. Poor Tex, he was quite a shark.

",48,3,16
"10484","Leela: Since when are you my agent?
",48,3,16
"10485","Bender: Quiet, call coming in. [He clicks his headset.] Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!

",48,3,16
"10488","Leela: [reading] As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean balls. So I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans: They're the beaniest!

",48,3,16
"10503","Leela: I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.

",48,3,16
"10505","Leela: What? Who are you?

"10508","Jackie: Pft. God forbid! Your little freakshow is making it impossible for real female ball players to be taken seriously. I hope you're proud of yourself.

"10511","Amy: Don't be upset, Leela. You, um ... you look really cute in your uniform.
",48,3,16
"10512","Leela: [crying] That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
",48,3,16

",48,3,16
"10514","Leela: You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time.
",48,3,16

",48,3,16
"10520","Bender: It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
",48,3,16

",48,3,16
"10522","Leela: It's even a crummy hologram.

",48,3,16
"10524","Fry: Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
",48,3,16
"10525","Aaron Sr.: No, I was better than great. I was the home run king!

",48,3,16
"10528","Aaron Jr.: Well, I had a low batting average.
",48,3,16
"10529","Aaron Sr.: Low? It was zero, you fungo! You went your whole career without getting a hit.
",48,3,16
"10530","Fry: Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.

"10532","Aaron Jr.: Forget it. This job's too cushy to give up. [He picks up Wade Boggs' head in a jar and drinks from it.] Ah, Wade Boggs! Goes down smooth!
",48,3,16
"10533","Leela: Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help. So I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you.
",48,3,16
"10534","Aaron Jr.: Oh, I can't help you play better than Tiny Iota. That guy was great. But I'll teach you everything I know.
",48,3,16
"10535","Aaron Jr.: OK, let's see what you can do.
",48,3,16
"10536","Bender: One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
",48,3,16
"10537","Leela: [quietly] Alright. Low and away.
",48,3,16
"10538","Aaron Jr.: OK, try it again. But this time keep your eye off the ball.
",48,3,16
"10539","Leela: You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?
",48,3,16
"10540","Aaron Jr.: Hey, lady, which one of us is in the hall of fame?
",48,3,16
"10541","Fry: [whispering] Pst. You're holding the bat upside down.
",48,3,16
"10542","Aaron Jr.: Just pitch the ball.
",48,3,16
"10543","Leela: OK. Eye off the ball.
",48,3,16
"10544","Bender: Strike!
",48,3,16
"10545","Fry: Hooray!
",48,3,16
"10546","Aaron Jr.: You did it, Leela!
",48,3,16
"10547","Leela: I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
",48,3,16
"10548","Aaron Jr.: Oh, you got that too? I think there's a rash goin' around.
",48,3,16
"10549","Uecker: Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Poindexters, where the Mets close out a season that'll rank among Mankind's most awful crimes.
",48,3,16
"10550","Fry: Hey! You opened a franchise!
",48,3,16
"10551","Cygnoid Woman: Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several things that look like beans.

",48,3,16
"10553","Blek: Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!
",48,3,16
"10554","Cygnoid Woman: My husband, some hotshot! Here's his ancient Cygnoid secret! [She holds up a jar.] Live hornets! We smush them right into dough!

"10555","Gilman: I don't care if there's horse manure in it!
",48,3,16
"10556","Blek: That's a-good!
",48,3,16
"10557","Gilman: I wanna buy this franchise. How does $100,000 sound?
",48,3,16
"10558","Blek: Forget it! We come to Earth to make pizza, not money.

"10559","Cygnoid Woman: No, Blek! Other way around!
",48,3,16
"10560","Blek: Oh, right. Offer accepted!
",48,3,16
"10561","Uecker: Well, fans, Boston's turning the last game into a real ""squeeeker""! And that's with three ""e's""! Two men on and they're down to their last out.
",48,3,16
"10562","Leela: Come on, skipper. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in.
",48,3,16
"10563","Skipper: No. We're actually winning this game. You only go in as a joke when we're eight runs behind. Or when our other pitchers sneak out early to beat the traffic. [Leela turns away and sits down.] [shouting] Come on! Let's see some fundamentals out there! [The clown honks his horn.] And not clown fundamentals. [A Boston player hits the ball and it bounces over to the clown. Instead of throwing it to another player he throws a pie instead. The skipper kicks the ground.] Aw, darn, darn darn! Now the bases are loaded! Isn't there a man on this team who can get one more out?
",48,3,16
"10564","Leela: I can.
",48,3,16
"10565","Skipper: I repeat: Isn't there a man on this team on this--
",48,3,16
"10566","Leela: I've been training with Hank Aaron.
",48,3,16
"10567","Skipper: You've been training with the Hank Aaron?
",48,3,16
"10568","Leela: I've been training with a Hank Aaron.

",48,3,16
"10577","Uecker: Would you look at that! College blernsball's finest female hitter making her big league debut against pro-ball's worst female anything. I've never seen anything this bizarre, and I've seen Mr. Belvedere naked! Woo!
",48,3,16
"10578","Leela: [quietly] Keep cool. She's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time.
",48,3,16

"10582","Uecker: [on loudspeaker] Remember, fans, this exciting moment is brought to you by Month Old Franks, the hotdogs with experience! Mmm-mmm! [Leela and Jackie wipe their brows. Hermes wipes his brow with a sponge, and squeezes it into a file marked ""Ballpark Sweat"". Leela throws the ball, Jackie swings and hits it. The elastic tightens and breaks. The crowd look up and gasp. While they aren't looking, Bender chuckles and steals some drinks from the people in front of him. Amy takes one too. The un-tethered ball flies through the air and into a target marked ""Hit It Here And Win The Game"". The target lights up, a bell rings, Jackie runs around the pitch, the giant rats run out and the Slurm blimp crashes.] A grand slam blern. The Mets lose! Their season is over! And no question, Leela, the first woman ever to reach the Majors, will go down as the single worst player in the history of blernsball! [Leela walks sadly to the bench. Jackie jumps around with joy and the Boston players lift her up.] And yet tonight we have witnessed the beginning of a great career for the first woman to play the sport well -- Jackie Anderson!
",48,3,16
"10583","Jackie: Leela?
",48,3,16
"10584","Leela: Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
",48,3,16
"10585","Jackie: No, don't be. It turns out you were an inspiration after all.
",48,3,16
"10586","Leela: [crying] I was?
",48,3,16
"10587","Jackie: Uh-huh. You were so awful that women everywhere set out to prove they don't stink as bad as you. You know, like a pig or something.
",48,3,16
"10588","Leela: Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all.
",48,3,16

",49,3,17
"10595","Linda: [on TV] Earlier today, a foul-mouthed bandit robbed the municipal pool, making off with the contents of over three lockers.
",49,3,17
"10596","Bender: More like three lockers and a sink!
",49,3,17
"10597","Leela: Bender? Did you have something to do with this?

",49,3,17
"10608","Fry: Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
",49,3,17

",49,3,17
"10610","Fry: Well, there's the material rewards.
",49,3,17
"10611","Bender: You mean this junk? [He opens his chest cabinet and water floods out along with a beach ball, a float, a bikini top and a small child.]

",49,3,17

"10632","Bender: Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
",49,3,17
"10633","Fry: Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk.
",49,3,17
"10634","Bender: Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death.
",49,3,17
"10635","Fry: Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
",49,3,17
"10636","Farnsworth: Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity.
",49,3,17
"10637","Bender: [crying] It's what made me me.
",49,3,17
"10638","Hermes: If you ever needed a small package brought into the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity.
",49,3,17

",49,3,17
"10640","Leela: Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead.
",49,3,17

"10646","Zoidberg: I'm expressing my sorrow.
",49,3,17
"10647","Bender: Get lost! I'd say ""Don't quit your day job"" but you're awful at that too.
",49,3,17
"10648","Leela: We're trying our best.
",49,3,17
"10649","Bender: Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!
",49,3,17
"10650","Amy: Bender was a truly special--
",49,3,17
"10651","Bender: [shouting] Louder and sadder.
",49,3,17
"10652","Amy: [shouting] Bender was a truly special--

",49,3,17
"10657","Bender: Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
",49,3,17
"10658","Fry: Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this: Bender was my friend.
",49,3,17
"10659","Bender: What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! [He pushes his legs through the bottom of the coffin and stands up.] I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck.
",49,3,17
"10660","Amy: I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!
",49,3,17
"10661","Farnsworth: [bashful] Oh, stop!
",49,3,17
"10662","Farnsworth: News, everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enormous sandstone block.
",49,3,17

",49,3,17
"10664","Fry: Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here.
",49,3,17
"10665","Osiran: Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million identical stones used in the future tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.
",49,3,17
"10666","Leela: Impressive. Who's building it?
",49,3,17
"10667","Osiran: You.
",49,3,17
"10668","Leela: Say again?
",49,3,17
"10669","Osiran: You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards.
",49,3,17
"10670","Fry: Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
",49,3,17
"10671","Fry: You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
",49,3,17
"10672","Leela: That's the only thing about being a slave!
",49,3,17
"10673","Osiran: Attention. You are now possessions of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip, heir to the Tenth Dynasty, bringer of the good aspects of the annual floods.
",49,3,17
"10674","Fry: Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
",49,3,17
"10675","Osiran: That is no coincidence. For our people visited your Egypt thousands of years ago.
",49,3,17
"10676","Fry: I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion.
",49,3,17
"10677","Osiran: We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid-building, space travel and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
",49,3,17
"10678","Fry: Also Wolfman!
",49,3,17
"10679","Bender: Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
",49,3,17
"10680","Leela: Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
",49,3,17
"10681","Bender: Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him. [He looks across at a slave being whipped as he carves a stone toe.] I think I'm gonna like it here!
",49,3,17
"10682","Man #1: Yeah, I, uh, noticed your sign and I thought I'd come over here and look into getting involved in your program.
",49,3,17
"10683","Man #2: What we do is make you starve to death.
",49,3,17
"10684","Osiran: One, two, three, pull! [He whips them and they pull.] One, two, three, pull!
",49,3,17
"10685","Australian Man: Oh! Bloody chunder!
",49,3,17
"10686","Bender: Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?
",49,3,17
"10687","Osiran: Good idea, slave. [He whips Bender and counts quicker.] One-half, pull! [He whips them.] One-half, pull!
",49,3,17
"10688","Bender: Now we're slavin'!
",49,3,17
"10689","Bender: Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this. [He pushes a block up the side of the tomb and the Osiran runs after him, whipping as he goes. He stops to catch his breath.] You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this.
",49,3,17
"10690","Leela: Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!
",49,3,17
"10691","Fry: Yeah. Remember who your real friends are.
",49,3,17
"10692","Bender: I'll tell you who I remember. [He points at some tombs.] Anopsis ... Pleotut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all.
",49,3,17

",49,3,17
"10706","High Priest: We commend the body of Hermenthotip to the abode of the damned. The damned good looking! [He grins but no one laughs.] Pharaoh commanded me to tell that joke at his funeral.
",49,3,17
"10707","Bender: [crying] I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!
",49,3,17
"10708","High Priest: To equip Pharaoh for his journey, we bury him with his favourite possessions. Such as his heart and liver. [The slaves lower some canopic jars into the hole.] And the many goods he left in his royal garage. [A pickup truck back up to the hole and tips Hermenthotip's stuff into it.] Also, this bag of cats our culture considers holy.

"10709","Singer: [singing] Pharaoh my God-king,

"10712","Osiran: Hermenthotip is gone. The time to designate a new Pharaoh is at hand.
",49,3,17
"10713","Bender: Wow!
",49,3,17
"10714","Osiran: At dawn tomorrow, the high priest will consult the Wall of Prophecy to determine Hermenthotip's successor. [He points across the river at the illuminated wall. Bender hoots.] That concludes the funeral. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.

",50,3,18
"10802","Farnsworth: Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon.

"10940","Mom: Damn this DSL! [She cackles and opens a cage, letting out her flying monkey-sons.] Fly, my stupids! Fly out and get them!
",50,3,18
"10941","Igner: But, Mom, you promised you'd bake monkey cake today.
",50,3,18
"10942","Mom: By ""monkey cake"" I meant your ass!
",50,3,18
"10943","Fry: Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz.
",50,3,18
"10944","Zoidberg: What, do I smell or something?
",50,3,18
"10945","Leela: Why did you bring us here?
",50,3,18
"10946","Zoidberg: And why did I have to take a cab?
",50,3,18
"10947","Mom: I'll tell you why I brought you here, you twice-baked barf bags: Because I've always wanted a daughter to love. You want to get adopted, you little skank?
",50,3,18
"10948","Leela: And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox.
",50,3,18
"10949","Mom: Absolutely.
",50,3,18
"10950","Leela: Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!
",50,3,18
"10951","Bender: Hooray!
",50,3,18
"10952","Zoidberg: Alright!
",50,3,18
"10953","Fry: That's great, Leela.
",50,3,18
"10954","Bender: I've heard worse excuses to drink. [He opens the bottle and it sprays over Mom.] Oops!
",50,3,18
"10955","Mom: I'm melting! Oh, who would have thought a small amount of liquid would ever fall on me?
",50,3,18
"10956","Bender: Well, no point letting her go to waste.
",50,3,18
"10957","Hermes: [from inside] Yes?
",50,3,18
"10958","Leela: We're here to see the Professor.
",50,3,18
"10959","Hermes: [from inside] No one sees the mighty Professor.
",50,3,18
"10960","Farnsworth: [from inside] Who's there, Hermes? Is it visitors? I want to see them.
",50,3,18
"10961","Hermes: [shouting; from inside] It's nobody. Now sign that will I gave you! [He turns to Leela.] He's not here.
",50,3,18
"10962","Leela: Oh, for the love of Benji!
",50,3,18
"10963","Farnsworth: I am the Professor, great and ... uh ... forgetful! [Nibbler pulls back the curtain revealing Farnsworth's big head on a small body.] Now, what do you nice kids want?
",50,3,18
"10964","Zoidberg: Nothing! I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe?
",50,3,18
"10965","Farnsworth: Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?
",50,3,18
"10966","Zoidberg: No, world, you put your hands up!
",50,3,18
"10967","Farnsworth: And you, lad, all you need is brain.
",50,3,18
"10968","Fry: Why does everyone keep saying that?
",50,3,18
"10969","Bender: This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!
",50,3,18
"10970","Farnsworth: Here you go, my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks.
",50,3,18
"10971","Bender: Oh, crap.
",50,3,18
"10972","Farnsworth: As for you, young lady, you want to go home, right?
",50,3,18
"10973","Leela: No, not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch.
",50,3,18
"10974","Farnsworth: Nonsense. Now click your big, honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poverty with your dirt-farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle.
",50,3,18
"10975","Leela: Uh, alright. Here I go. [She clicks her boots together three times.] There's no place like-- I wanna be a witch! [She turns into a witch, complete with pointed hat. Everyone gasps and she turns Fry, Farnsworth and Bender into frogs and laughs. Water falls on her from above and she starts to melt.] Oh, no! Help! What's happening?
",50,3,18
"10976","Zoidberg: Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet.
",50,3,18
"10977","Bender: Wake up!
",50,3,18
"10978","Fry: Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
",50,3,18
"10979","Leela: I was having the most wonderful dream. [She points at Fry, Amy and Zoidberg.] Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there.
",50,3,18
"10980","Fry: Never mind, Professor. She came to.
",50,3,18
"10981","Farnsworth: Oh! So close.
",50,3,18
"10982","Hermes: There's always next year, Professor. There's always next year.
",50,3,18
"10983","Fry: I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!
",51,3,19
"10984","Bender: Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry, could you go make some popcorn?
",51,3,19
"10985","Fry: OK.
",51,3,19
"10986","Fry: Let's go, microwave, I'm in a hurry here! [He opens the door and hesitates before he puts it in.] Hm? [He reads the ""Warning: Do Not Put In Microwave"" label, tears it off and chuckles. He puts the packet in the microwave and presses the button. The popcorn fizzles and blue light leaks out of the microwave and begins to engulf the room.] Hey, what smells like blue?
",51,3,19
"10987","Leela: [shouting] Fry, get up here! It's starting!
",51,3,19
"10988","Farnsworth: Focus!
",51,3,19
"10989","Bender: Oh, boy!
",51,3,19
"10990","Leela: Oh!
",51,3,19
"10991","Fry: Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?
",51,3,19
"10992","Zoidberg: My head is spinning.
",51,3,19
"10993","Fry: Ooh! My popcorn's done!
",51,3,19
"10994","Fry: Aw! It's less popped than ever.
",51,3,19
"10995","Leela: I don't know what happened, but we've taken on a lot of clocks. [She indicates the clocks on the floor.] Let's get back home.
",51,3,19
"10996","Leela: Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
",51,3,19
"10997","Farnsworth: And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
",51,3,19
"10998","Zoidberg: Such noises!
",51,3,19
"10999","Leela: Oh, no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing.
",51,3,19
"11000","Fry: We're gonna crash!
",51,3,19
"11001","Leela: Not if I can help it! [The engines cut out.] Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts.
",51,3,19
"11002","Bender: Ah, those things cost more lives than they save.
",51,3,19
"11003","Fry: Bender, are you OK?
",51,3,19
"11004","Bender: I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
",51,3,19
"11005","Leela: Alright, here's the plan: Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five.
",51,3,19
"11006","Zoidberg: And Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild! [He mimes a cheering crowd. Car headlights shine in his eyes and he shields them.] What is?
",51,3,19
"11007","Man: General, in all my years of covering top secret discoveries with sheets, I've never dramatically revealed anything as shocking as this. Dun-dun-dun! The debris from an alien spaceship.
",51,3,19
"11008","General: Son, I think I can safely say--
",51,3,19
"11009","Man: As you can see, 1947 is going to be an eventful year for the town of ... Roswell, New Mexico.
",51,3,19
"11010","Farnsworth: Remarkable! According the high-precision digital chronograph it's July 9th, 1947, which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar.
",51,3,19
"11011","Bender: Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
",51,3,19
"11012","Farnsworth: Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave--
",51,3,19
"11013","Fry: Yo!
",51,3,19
"11014","Farnsworth: And the microwave radiation, combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova, blasted us through time itself.
",51,3,19
"11015","Leela: Have you seen today's news?
",51,3,19
"11016","Bender: High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
",51,3,19
"11017","Leela: No, over here! [She points at the headline.] [reading] Flying saucer captured!
",51,3,19
"11018","Bender: That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!
",51,3,19
"11019","Fry: My God! This means the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell ... was us!
",51,3,19
"11020","Farnsworth: And the alien they captured was ... was...
",51,3,19
"11021","Zoidberg: Hello! [The general winces.] So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
",51,3,19
"11022","Farnsworth: Yes, we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope to get back to our own time is to go through it in, oh, say ... [He looks at his watch.] ... exactly 24 hours.
",51,3,19
"11023","Leela: No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I should have that operational within 10 hours.
",51,3,19
"11024","Farnsworth: You've got eight! But a more urgent concern is the microwave. [He picks up the charred microwave.] Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
",51,3,19
"11025","Leela: Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave somewhere around here. [She turns to Fry.] Meanwhile, you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body.
",51,3,19
"11026","Fry: Hey, and while we're on the base, I'll visit my grandfather, Enos. He was stationed at Roswell.
",51,3,19
"11027","Farnsworth: Your grandfather? [He leaps up, causing the microwave to shatter on the floor.] Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey! You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!
",51,3,19
"11028","Fry: Got it.
",51,3,19
"11029","Farnsworth: If, for example, you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist.
",51,3,19
"11030","Fry: But existing is basically all I do!
",51,3,19
"11031","General: What is your purpose here?
",51,3,19
"11032","Zoidberg: [drowsy] Alright, Officer, I'll move along.
",51,3,19
"11033","Man: What the general means is why did you come to Earth?
",51,3,19
"11034","Zoidberg: Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
",51,3,19
"11035","Sergeant: [shouting] Enos! [Fry gasps and takes Bender's eyes off his head and uses them to zoom in. He sees Enos and a sergeant yelling at him.] Private, I want that toilet bowl so clean I could eat off it! 'Cause I intend to!
",51,3,19
"11036","Enos: Well gadzooks, Sarge!
",51,3,19
"11037","Fry: It's him! It's my grandfather, Enos.
",51,3,19
"11038","Sergeant: [shouting] Now prepare my lunch and place it in the latrine at twelve-hundred hours!
",51,3,19
"11039","Fry: That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore! [Screaming, he runs and pushes Enos out of the way of the slow-moving Jeep, which turns right before it gets to them.] Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
",51,3,19
"11040","Enos: I did? Then I sure am lucky you knocked me onto this pile of rusty bayonets!
",51,3,19
"11041","Bender: Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back.
",51,3,19
"11042","Fry: [whispering] I had no choice; I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear.
",51,3,19
"11043","Enos: Well, thanks, soldier. I'm off to make Sarge's lunch! Handling raw chicken, best part of the job! [He licks his fingers.] Mmm! Finger-licking good!
",51,3,19
"11044","Fry: That's it! This place is too dangerous. We gotta get you out of here! [He stoops to Enos's crotch.] [shouting] Everything's gonna be alright, Dad!
",51,3,19
"11045","Enos: Well gadzooks! I'd better ask Sarge.
",51,3,19
"11046","Fry: [shouting] No time! Run! Run to safety!
",51,3,19
"11047","Man: This experiment will determine what food, if any, the alien eats.
",51,3,19
"11048","Zoidberg: A buffet! Oh, if only I had my wallet with me!
",51,3,19
"11049","Man: Um, it's free.
",51,3,19
"11050","General: Get me the President.
",51,3,19
"11051","Leela: Fry's from around this time. I'll talk like him. [She approaches a salesman.] Yo, homes! We're looking for a microwave oven.
",51,3,19
"11052","Salesman: Microwave? Never heard of that brand, sweetheart. What you want is the ""Deluxe Gas Princess"". [He indicates an oven.] This beauty has four broilers, a casserole indicator, a fold-out ironing board and, down here, a foot-soaking tub. Since, as a woman, you'll be standing in front of it all day.
",51,3,19
"11053","Leela: Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll aks you again: Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?
",51,3,19
"11054","Salesman: Sir, your wife's hysterical, so I'll address this to you. This oven is lightning fast. It takes only five hours to cook a roast.
",51,3,19
"11055","Farnsworth: Ooh, that's good news! You know, you really don't cook enough roasts, Leela. [Leela turns the gas hob on and sets fire to Farnsworth's tie. He turns to the salesman.] Women!
",51,3,19
"11056","Fry: Thank God I got you off that dangerous army base.
",51,3,19
"11057","Enos: You sure are the helpful type, stranger. Say, you got anything to eat in that there lunchbox? [He reaches into Bender's head and takes out some microchips.] Ooh! Snacks!
",51,3,19
"11058","Bender: Hey! That's my brain!
",51,3,19
"11059","Enos: Damn! Them crackers cut my mouth up somethin' bad! Let's stop off for a malt.
",51,3,19
"11060","Enos: See that waitress there?
",51,3,19
"11061","Fry: Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
",51,3,19
"11062","Enos: That's my fiancée, Mildred.
",51,3,19
"11063","Fry: Grandma Mildred? Uh, no dessert! Just coffee.
",51,3,19
"11064","Mildred: Okie-doke. And for you, Snuggums?
",51,3,19
"11065","Enos: Uh, I'll have a pie with a fried egg on top.
",51,3,19
"11066","Fry: She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
",51,3,19
"11067","Enos: Yeah, folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls 'cause you're supposed to?
",51,3,19
"11068","Fry: What? Don't ever, ever say or think that again! Please! Just concentrate on staying alive. [A flame in the kitchen flares and Fry gasps.] Fire! Look out! [He leans forward and knocks the table over. The cutlery slides off and a knife lands inches from Enos's crotch.] Oh! You almost got neutered.
",51,3,19
"11069","Enos: Well it ain't as bad as getting killed.
",51,3,19
"11070","Fry: For me it is! [He stands up.] I'm getting you outta here!
",51,3,19
"11071","Enos: Ow!
",51,3,19
"11072","Fry: OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.
",51,3,19
"11073","Fry: Safe and sound! Finally, I can continue to exist.
",51,3,19
"11074","Man #2: Three, two, one.
",51,3,19
"11075","Bender: And you are outta here!
",51,3,19
"11076","Mildred: What'll you folks have today?
",51,3,19
"11077","Farnsworth: I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw.
",51,3,19
"11078","Mildred: Pardon?
",51,3,19
"11079","Leela: [whispering] It's the 20th century, Professor.
",51,3,19
"11080","Farnsworth: Oh, right! I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead.
",51,3,19
"11081","Leela: I'll just have a small injection of Femislim.
",51,3,19
"11082","Mildred: Uh, two chilli dogs comin' up.
",51,3,19
"11083","Leela: Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period.
",51,3,19
"11084","Farnsworth: Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper and then the terrible tragedy of his death.
",51,3,19
"11085","Leela: Wait a second! There's a microwave radar dish at the army base.  We could steal it!
",51,3,19
"11086","Farnsworth: No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was.
",51,3,19
"11087","Fry: Well, I killed my grandfather.
",51,3,19
"11088","Farnsworth: Wha?
",51,3,19
"11089","Leela: Wait. If you killed your grandfather, why do you still exist?
",51,3,19
"11090","Fry: I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
",51,3,19
"11091","Mildred: Killed? In an atomic blast? [crying] No, sir, I'm afraid I don't take much solace in the fact that the implosion trigger functioned perfectly.
",51,3,19
"11092","Fry: Aw. There, there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vaporised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie.
",51,3,19
"11093","Mildred: [crying] I'm not worried about that.
",51,3,19
"11094","Fry: Then you're a braver woman than I.
",51,3,19
"11095","Mildred: You remind me of Enos. Would you mind walking me home?
",51,3,19
"11096","Fry: Uh, how far is it?
",51,3,19
"11097","General: Welcome to Roswell, President Truman.
",51,3,19
"11098","Truman: Fellas, this visit's top secret. No one's to know about it except the senior officers ... [They salute.] ... scientists ... [They nod.] ... and a single conspiracy nutter no one will believe.
",51,3,19
"11099","General: Mr. President, our men have assembled the parts from the alien ship into its original design.
",51,3,19
"11100","Truman: Whistling Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
",51,3,19
"11101","General: But, sir, that's where we're building the fake moon landing set.
",51,3,19
"11102","Truman: Then we'll have to really land on the moon. Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fannies!
",51,3,19
"11103","Truman: If you come in peace, surrender or be destroyed. If you're here to make war, we surrender.
",51,3,19
"11104","Zoidberg: Both good. The important thing is I'm meeting new people.
",51,3,19
"11105","Truman: Bushwah! Now what's your mission? Are you planning to make some kind of alien-human hybrid?
",51,3,19
"11106","Zoidberg: Are you coming onto me?
",51,3,19
"11107","Truman: Hot crackers! I take exception to that!
",51,3,19
"11108","Zoidberg: [sexfully] I'm not hearing a no.
",51,3,19
"11109","Truman: Nerks to this space crab! If we want information, we'll have to do us an old-fashioned alien autopsy!
",51,3,19
"11110","Zoidberg: Hooray!
",51,3,19
"11111","Mildred: [crying] Every little thing reminds me of Enos.
",51,3,19
"11112","Fry: Aw, I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently.
",51,3,19
"11113","Mildred: It's all so sad. At times like this, I just need someone to hold me. [She puts her arms around Fry.] Mmm. [sexfully] You like holding me, don't you?
",51,3,19
"11114","Fry: Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!
",51,3,19
"11115","Mildred: How 'bout these cookies, sugar?
",51,3,19
"11116","Fry: I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do exist. Which proves ... you can't really be my grandm--
",51,3,19
"11117","Bender: [from outside] Oh, my God!
",51,3,19
"11118","Farnsworth: What the hell have you done, Fry?
",51,3,19
"11119","Fry: Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
",51,3,19
"11120","Farnsworth: Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!
",51,3,19
"11121","Mildred: Come back to bed, deary.
",51,3,19
"11122","Fry: It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?
",51,3,19
"11123","Farnsworth: Isn't it obvious? [Fry shakes his head.] You are!
",51,3,19
"11124","Mildred: Did you say something, deary? I'm a bit hard of hearing.
",51,3,19
"11125","Pathologist #1: Commencing excavation of the subject's chest cavity.
",51,3,19
"11126","Zoidberg: And in this corner, Zoidberg! [He laughs.] C'mon! Lighten up! What is this, a funeral?
",51,3,19
"11127","Pathologist #2: Heart.
",51,3,19
"11128","Zoidberg: Take, I've got four of them.

",51,3,19
"11132","Leela: Snap out of it!
",51,3,19
"11133","Farnsworth: Start the ship, Leela. Let's just steal the damn radar dish and get back to our own time.
",51,3,19
"11134","Fry: But-- But won't that change history?
",51,3,19
"11135","Farnsworth: [sarcastic] Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!

Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.

",52,3,20

",52,3,20

",52,3,20

"11204","(06:17) ⨂Farnsworth: No. I'm afraid the Smellescope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.

",52,3,20
"11206","(06:35) ⨂Amy: Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up.

",52,3,20

"11210","(06:48) ⨂Helper: Who wants to go to an amusement park?
",52,3,20
"11211","(06:49) ⨂Fry: Well, I guess that sounds OK.
",52,3,20
"11212","(06:50) ⨂Helper: Have a good time. Hey, I heard your friend Bender is back.
",52,3,20
"11213","(06:53) ⨂Fry: What? Really?
",52,3,20
"11214","(06:55) ⨂Helper: No. I just thought you would enjoy that for a moment.
",52,3,20
"11215","(07:15) ⨂Bender: Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them. [He reaches out and picks up Malachi.] Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight.
",52,3,20
"11216","(07:29) ⨂Malachi: Yes, tonight is kind of special.
",52,3,20
"11217","(07:31) ⨂Bender: Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
",52,3,20
"11218","(07:34) ⨂Malachi: Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed while building the Great Brewery. [The Shrimpkins lack various limbs and behind them is a large graveyard.] Others died from the pestilent fumes it spewed forth. [On the porch of her home, Malachi's wife sits with the baby.] And, of course, the liquor industry attracted organised crime.
",52,3,20
"11219","(07:58) ⨂Bender: It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight.
",52,3,20
"11220","(08:25) ⨂Malachi's Wife: Malachi Jr., no!
",52,3,20
"11221","(08:28) ⨂Malachi Jr.: Daddy, I can't hold much longer. My arms are tired from hugging.
",52,3,20
"11222","(08:33) ⨂Malachi: Save him! Save my son, oh Metal Lord!
",52,3,20
"11223","(08:36) ⨂Bender: This looks like a job for God! [He pulls Malachi Jr. out of the tear river and puts him down on the bank. Father and son hug and the Shrimpkins gasp and bow.] What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?
",52,3,20
"11224","(08:52) ⨂Malachi: They saw you save my son. Now everyone is praying for their own miracles.
",52,3,20
"11225","(08:57) ⨂Bender: Very well. What do they want?
",52,3,20
"11226","(08:59) ⨂Malachi: The people of that village pray for wealth.
",52,3,20
"11227","(09:10) ⨂Bender: Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?
",52,3,20
"11228","(09:18) ⨂Malachi: The farmers pray for sunlight so their barley might make a more refreshing beer for today's God on the go.
",52,3,20
"11229","(09:24) ⨂Bender: Very well. Let there be light. [He closes his eye visor and reflects the rays of a star onto the farmers' fields. They cheer but the fields burst into flames and so do the farmers.] I got it! I got it! [He blows the flames out and also blows several Shrimpkins off his body and into space.] Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.
",52,3,20
"11230","(09:51) ⨂Fry: He decided not to let go. [He puts the picture down and looks at one on the wall of Bender sat on a throne dressed as Napoleon.] I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperate and crazy!
",52,3,20
"11231","(10:10) ⨂Fry: So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?
",52,3,20
"11232","(10:16) ⨂Changstein el Gamahl: Well, we could join together in prayer.
",52,3,20
"11233","(10:19) ⨂Fry: Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?
",52,3,20
"11234","(10:22) ⨂Changstein el Gamahl: No.
",52,3,20
"11235","(10:23) ⨂Gypsy: Sure I hold séance, channel your friend, no problem. Insert coin. [Fry inserts 5 cents and the Gypsy moans as she ""channels"" Bender.] I am your friend, Bonder.
",52,3,20
"11236","(10:34) ⨂Fry: Bonder? Is it really you?
",52,3,20
"11237","(10:36) ⨂Gypsy: Yes. I am fine. Give the gypsy $10.
",52,3,20
"11238","(10:40) ⨂Fry: Wait a minute! Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!
",52,3,20
"11239","(10:45) ⨂Gypsy: Look, you want false hope or not?
",52,3,20
"11240","(10:47) ⨂Fry: Only if you don't have any real hope.
",52,3,20
"11241","(10:49) ⨂Gypsy: Well, there is perhaps one way. Have you heard of the Monks of Dschubba?
",52,3,20
"11242","(10:54) ⨂Fry: I've not heard of them.
",52,3,20
"11243","(10:56) ⨂Gypsy: They are an ancient order that believes God exists somewhere in the depths of space. They have built the universe's most powerful radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, to search for him.
",52,3,20
"11244","(11:08) ⨂Fry: You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
",52,3,20
"11245","(11:10) ⨂Gypsy: What am I, psychic? I mean, yes! Yes, I'm-I'm sure they will. Yes.
",52,3,20
"11246","(11:30) ⨂Malachi: Oh, Metal Lord, hear my prayer.
",52,3,20
"11247","(11:34) ⨂Bender: [irate] Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?
",52,3,20
"11248","(11:36) ⨂Malachi: My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.
",52,3,20
"11249","(11:42) ⨂Bender: Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
",52,3,20
"11250","(11:47) ⨂Malachi: They talk of war against the faithful. I beseech thee. Rise up against them. Smite someone who deserves it for once.
",52,3,20
"11251","(11:55) ⨂Bender: Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems.
",52,3,20
"11252","(12:01) ⨂Malachi: But-But Metal Lord.
",52,3,20
"11253","(12:04) ⨂Bender: What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?
",52,3,20
"11254","(12:09) ⨂Fry: Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long-sleeved coat.
",52,3,20
"11255","(12:14) ⨂Leela: Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless.
",52,3,20
"11256","(12:20) ⨂Fry: You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!"" [He is still covering his ears.] [shouting] I'd also like a pack mule.
",52,3,20
"11257","(12:29) ⨂Salesman: [shouting] At once, sir!
",52,3,20
"11258","(12:33) ⨂Leela: Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come with you. But we'll need a sherpa to guide us.
",52,3,20
"11259","(12:47) ⨂Bender: Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling-- [Bombers fly around from Bender's ass and drop bombs on the Shrimpkin village.] Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!
",52,3,20
"11260","(13:05) ⨂Malachi: Fear not, my Lord. We shall be with you soon.
",52,3,20
"11261","(13:08) ⨂Bender: You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
",52,3,20
"11262","(13:12) ⨂Malachi: We will solve our own problems as you commanded. The time has come to convert the unbelievers.
",52,3,20
"11263","(13:18) ⨂Bender: Convert them?
",52,3,20
"11264","(13:19) ⨂Malachi: To radioactive vapour!
",52,3,20
"11265","(13:31) ⨂Malachi Jr.: Look, Daddy! I'm hugging God. Mmm! Mmm! Maybe if I hug him real hard he'll save us from--
",52,3,20
"11266","(13:41) ⨂Bender: [crying] No! [More bombs explode on him.] [laughing] Ooh! It tickles!
",52,3,20
"11267","(13:53) ⨂Bender: Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre? [He takes the roof off Ezekiel's Nasty House.] Don't be embarrassed. [He groans.] [crying] They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
",52,3,20
"11268","(14:17) ⨂Leela: [shouting] Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that ""huddled over for warmth"" crap.
",52,3,20
"11269","(14:29) ⨂Namgyal: Behold. The Monastery of Dschubba. I must leave you now for I am not holy enough to enter.
",52,3,20
"11270","(14:36) ⨂Fry: OK.
",52,3,20
"11271","(14:44) ⨂Leela: Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
",52,3,20
"11272","(14:53) ⨂Female Voice: Welcome to our monastery. Please stand to one side to let faster pilgrims by.
",52,3,20
"11273","(15:11) ⨂Bender: Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. [shouting] You speak English?

"11274","(15:20) ⨂Galaxy: I do now.
",52,3,20
"11275","(15:28) ⨂Bender: What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?
",52,3,20
"11276","(15:30) ⨂Galaxy: Possible. I am user friendly, my good chum.
",52,3,20
"11277","(15:34) ⨂Bender: Who built you?
",52,3,20
"11278","(15:36) ⨂Galaxy: I have always been.
",52,3,20
"11279","(15:37) ⨂Bender: Oh, my God. Are you God?
",52,3,20
"11280","(15:41) ⨂""God"": Possible. I do feel compassion for all living things, my good chum.
",52,3,20
"11281","(15:46) ⨂Bender: But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God.
",52,3,20
"11282","(15:56) ⨂""God"": That seems probable.
",52,3,20
"11283","(16:02) ⨂Monk #1: A member of our brotherhood sits at these controls every hour of every day, scanning the heavens for God.
",52,3,20
"11284","(16:09) ⨂Monk #2: There he is! No. No, wait, no.
",52,3,20
"11285","(16:12) ⨂Leela: How long have you been at it?
",52,3,20
"11286","(16:14) ⨂Monk #1: 700 years. We've not yet examined one-ten-millionth of the sky. But we will go on until we find the Almighty, even if it takes till the end of time.
",52,3,20
"11287","(16:24) ⨂Fry: And then what?
",52,3,20
"11288","(16:25) ⨂Monk #1: Then we utter unto him a short prayer. You see, the telescope is also an amplifying transmitter.
",52,3,20
"11289","(16:31) ⨂Leela: Sort of like a giant karaoke machine?
",52,3,20
"11290","(16:33) ⨂Monk #1: Not really. Would you like to see our giant karaoke machine?
",52,3,20
"11291","(16:36) ⨂Leela: Not really.
",52,3,20
"11292","(16:38) ⨂Fry: Hmm. Finding God. That-That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend, Bender.
",52,3,20
"11293","(16:45) ⨂Monk #1: I don't know what to say, other than ""absolutely not"". Your loss is a tragedy but our work--
",52,3,20
"11294","(16:51) ⨂Fry: Aw, come on! You guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.
",52,3,20
"11295","(16:57) ⨂Monk #2: He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God.
",52,3,20
"11296","(17:02) ⨂Monk #1: Oh, how convenient! A theory about God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!
",52,3,20
"11297","(17:09) ⨂Fry: That telescope is as much mine as anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
",52,3,20
"11298","(17:17) ⨂Leela: Hi-yah! Your order may be famous for your martial arts, but I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber.
",52,3,20
"11299","(17:23) ⨂Monk #1: Actually, we only practise martial arts as a form of meditation. We are a strictly non-violent sect.
",52,3,20
"11300","(17:28) ⨂Leela: Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
",52,3,20
"11301","(17:34) ⨂Monk #3: This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.
",52,3,20
"11302","(17:38) ⨂Bender: So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?
",52,3,20
"11303","(17:41) ⨂""God"": Yes.
",52,3,20
"11304","(17:42) ⨂Bender: What if I do something different?
",52,3,20
"11305","(17:44) ⨂""God"": Then I don't know that.
",52,3,20
"11306","(17:45) ⨂Bender: Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?
",52,3,20
"11307","(17:49) ⨂""God"": Yes. But there are so many asking so much. After a while, you just sorta tune it out.
",52,3,20
"11308","(17:55) ⨂Bender: Y'know, I was God once.
",52,3,20
"11309","(17:57) ⨂""God"": Yes, I saw. You were doing well until everyone died.
",52,3,20
"11310","(18:01) ⨂Bender: It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?
",52,3,20
"11311","(18:10) ⨂""God"": Right and wrong are just words. What matters is what you do.
",52,3,20
"11312","(18:14) ⨂Bender: Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it.
",52,3,20
"11313","(18:19) ⨂""God"": Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch like a safecracker or a pickpocket.
",52,3,20
"11314","(18:30) ⨂Bender: Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
",52,3,20
"11315","(18:33) ⨂""God"": Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
",52,3,20
"11316","(18:43) ⨂Bender: Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?

",52,3,20
"11318","(18:51) ⨂Bender: [sadly] I don't know.
",52,3,20
"11319","(18:53) ⨂Fry: [shouting] Bender? Bender?
",52,3,20
"11320","(18:56) ⨂Monk #2: [from laundry room] Let us out! We cooked our shoes in the dryer and ate them. Now we're bored.

",52,3,20
"11322","(19:05) ⨂H.G. Blob: [on speaker] No! Quit asking.
",52,3,20
"11323","(19:08) ⨂Leela: Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up.
",52,3,20
"11324","(19:17) ⨂Fry: [sad] You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he-he actually stole my blood. [He spins the dish controller.] But still, I wish I had Bender back.
",52,3,20
"11325","(19:39) ⨂""God"": Huh?
",52,3,20
"11326","(19:42) ⨂Bender: Huh? Wha? You say something?
",52,3,20
"11327","(19:43) ⨂""God"": No, no. Well, so long. Remember what we talked about.
",52,3,20
"11328","(20:02) ⨂Bender: Hot, hot, hot, hot!
",52,3,20
"11329","(20:07) ⨂Fry: Bender! It's a miracle! [He hugs him and burns himself.] Ow!
",52,3,20
"11330","(20:13) ⨂Leela: This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened.
",52,3,20
"11331","(20:17) ⨂Bender: Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!
",52,3,20
"11332","(20:23) ⨂Fry: We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
",52,3,20
"11333","(20:24) ⨂Leela: Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
",52,3,20
"11334","(20:28) ⨂Fry: Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat.
",52,3,20
"11335","(20:34) ⨂Bender: Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!
",52,3,20
"11336","(20:54) ⨂""God"": When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
",52,3,20
"11337","Man: Yes! Good thing I noticed the similar shapes.
",53,3,21
"11338","Hermes: [from behind curtain] Planet Express stockholders, I present our chief executive officer, Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
",53,3,21
"11339","Farnsworth: Oh!
",53,3,21
"11340","Amy: There he is!
",53,3,21
"11341","Hattie: [shouting] Take it off!
",53,3,21
"11342","Farnsworth: Where am I?
",53,3,21
"11343","Hermes: Move forward. Walk into the light.
",53,3,21
"11344","Farnsworth: Oh, God, I'm dead! Well, no matter. [He takes some cards out of his coat and walks under the spotlight to the lectern.] [reading] Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now, without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.
",53,3,21
"11345","Narrator: [voice-over; in movie] Planet Express is on the move. For this hip, young delivery company, tomorrow is today and today is yesterday. You heard me. [The ship zooms off and the scene cuts to Fry handing a package to Kug.] It was a year of soaring profits and significant one-time losses.
",53,3,21
"11346","Fry: [whispering] Psst! Watching myself work is making me hungry. Help me find some food somewhere.
",53,3,21
"11347","Zoidberg: I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!
",53,3,21
"11348","Fry: Ooh! A Bot Mitzvah. Shalom, hunger! Shalom, free food!
",53,3,21
"11349","Robot #1: No shellfish!
",53,3,21
"11350","Zoidberg: That is so unfair!
",53,3,21
"11351","Pig: Tell me about it.
",53,3,21
"11352","Fry: So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
",53,3,21
"11353","Rabbi-bot: We believe he was built and that he was a very well programmed robot. But he wasn't our Messiah.
",53,3,21
"11354","Narrator: [voice-over; in movie] And so our company flames onwards. Planet Express: Limitless potential, boundless horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut of the corporate universe.
",53,3,21
"11355","Hermes: It's been a terrible year, people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
",53,3,21
"11356","Leela: But the movie--
",53,3,21
"11357","Hermes: Was a substantial loss for the company. [A pie chart appears on the screen showing a large green slice and a small blue slice.] The blue slice represents the money we earned from shipping packages, while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour.
",53,3,21
"11358","Leela: This toads the wet sprocket. What about out thousands of shares of stock?
",53,3,21
"11359","Hermes: Worthless.
",53,3,21
"11360","Bender: [shouting] I'll kill you!
",53,3,21
"11361","Hattie: I own one share of Planet kajiggers so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 1: Why does no one visit me in my home?
",53,3,21
"11362","Farnsworth: 'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
",53,3,21
"11363","Fry: This is perfect for me.
",53,3,21
"11364","Zoidberg: Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free-- [The man slams the door in his face.] You didn't let me finish. I was going to say ""to get the free food"".
",53,3,21
"11365","Joe: My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.
",53,3,21
"11366","All: [monotonous] Hello, Joe.
",53,3,21
"11367","Joe: When I was frozen, giant carrots ruled the Earth, but now they don't. It takes some getting used to.
",53,3,21
"11368","Steve Castle: Back in the 1980's, I was the toast of Wall Street. I was having whiskey with Boesky and cookies with Milken. But then, I was diagnosed with terminal boneitis.
",53,3,21
"11369","Fry: Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
",53,3,21
"11370","Steve Castle: There was no cure at the time. One drug company was close but I arranged a hostile takeover and sold off all the assets. Made a cool hundred mil. [He laughs and coughs. The group applauds.] Naturally I froze myself until a cure was found. Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way back to the top, 80's style!
",53,3,21
"11371","Caveman: As a caveman frozen in a glacier, I face different challenges. [crying] The hardest thing was seeing my wife on display in the British Museum.
",53,3,21
"11372","Fry: [whispering] Hey, buddy, I'm from the same time as you. Remember that song, Safety Dance?
",53,3,21
"11373","Steve Castle: Sure do! We can dance!
",53,3,21
"11374","Fry: Y'know, that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
",53,3,21
"11375","Steve Castle: I tell you: Two go-go 80's Reagan-auts like us, we could rule this world!
",53,3,21
"11376","Fry: No question!
",53,3,21
"11377","Steve Castle: If only someone would give us a shot.
",53,3,21
"11378","Fry: They're scared of our raw power. Oh, but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work.
",53,3,21
"11379","Steve Castle: Awesome. Awesome to the max!
",53,3,21
"11380","Hermes: And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only.
",53,3,21
"11381","Bender: Aw, come on! I've got a lot of ransom notes to send!
",53,3,21
"11382","Hattie: Enough talk. It's time for action. I move that everyone come to my apartment to snuggle my cat.
",53,3,21
"11383","Scruffy: Second.
",53,3,21
"11384","Farnsworth: I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
",53,3,21
"11385","Scruffy: Second.
",53,3,21
"11386","Hattie: I move that we vote on a new chief executive officer and oust this old creep. And also that make cat smells good and is pretty.
",53,3,21
"11387","Scruffy: Second.
",53,3,21
"11388","Hermes: Very well. I nominate the Professor.
",53,3,21
"11389","Amy: Second.
",53,3,21
"11390","Leela: Second.
",53,3,21
"11391","Bender: Second.
",53,3,21
"11392","Farnsworth: I'm your man.
",53,3,21
"11393","Leela: I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.
",53,3,21
"11394","Hermes: Yeah, the Professor!
",53,3,21
"11395","Farnsworth: Me!
",53,3,21
"11396","Fry: I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. [Everyone mutters. Fry pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from his jacket.] My shares still count if they went through the washing machine, right?
",53,3,21
"11397","Hermes: Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that--
",53,3,21
"11398","Scruffy: Now hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 shares for the mysterious stranger.
",53,3,21
"11399","Leela: 40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?
",53,3,21
"11400","Scruffy: Scruffy believes in this company.
",53,3,21
"11401","Hermes: Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie, the Professor, as the current CEO remains--
",53,3,21
"11402","Hattie: I demand the floor. I may only have one share but I get to vote same as anyone. And I'm voting against the cat-hater. [She pulls a cat out of her handbag.] Isn't that right, kitty? [The cat meows.] Hey! You ate my change!
",53,3,21
"11403","Hermes: Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy.
",53,3,21
"11404","Hermes: Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy.
",53,3,21
"11405","Steve Castle: Let's cut to the chase. There are two kinds of people: Sheep and sharks. Anyone who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
",53,3,21
"11406","Zoidberg: Uh, excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?
",53,3,21
"11407","Steve Castle: Gutsy question. You're a shark. Sharks are winners and they don't look back 'cause they don't have necks. Necks are for sheep. [Everyone sinks down and covers their necks.] I am proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks and I am gonna lead you to the top in this industry of ... of--
",53,3,21
"11408","Fry: [whispering] Package delivery.
",53,3,21
"11409","Steve Castle: Package delivery? Oh, God! [He covers his face.] Fantastic! Now, the first order of business is to blame everything on the guy before me. Professor?
",53,3,21
"11410","Farnsworth: I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
",53,3,21
"11411","Steve Castle: Terrific. Question number one: What was your overall business plan?
",53,3,21
"11412","Farnsworth: Um, business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here, right next to my heart.
",53,3,21
"11413","Steve Castle: This isn't a business plan, it's an escape plan.
",53,3,21
"11414","Farnsworth: So long, suckers!
",53,3,21
"11415","Steve Castle: Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar-jockey, I'm making you my new vice chairman.
",53,3,21
"11416","Fry: I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
",53,3,21
"11417","Zoidberg: It's the end of the line!
",53,3,21
"11418","Hermes: We're ruined!
",53,3,21
"11419","Scruffy: What fevered dream is this that bids to tear this company in twain?
",53,3,21
"11420","Monster: Thank you, come again!
",53,3,21
"11421","Steve Castle: That's what I call a hostile makeover! Hair gel?
",53,3,21
"11422","Fry: No, thanks. I make my own.
",53,3,21
"11423","Steve Castle: This company's gonna shoot straight to the top and stay there, like Cindy Lauper! I ask you: Who is the number one delivery service on Earth?
",53,3,21
"11424","Zoidberg: Is it Planet Express, master?
",53,3,21
"11425","Steve Castle: Is this guy a shark, or what? Seriously though, we stink out loud. Here's the big enchirito. [He opens the blind revealing Mom's building. The sign on the top of the building shows Mom bottle-feeding a parcel like a baby.] Mom's Friendly Delivery Company.
",53,3,21
"11426","Hermes: We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil. Ours is small and neutral.
",53,3,21
"11427","Steve Castle: Switzerland is small and neutral. We're more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.
",53,3,21
"11428","Amy: Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?
",53,3,21
"11429","Steve Castle: I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves get beaten by an old lady?
",53,3,21
"11430","Zoidberg: Yes, my liege!
",53,3,21
"11431","Fry: No, we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. [He pulls his trousers down and moons Mom.] Look at my butt!
",53,3,21
"11432","Mom: You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit the retaliate button.
",53,3,21
"11433","Walt: Uh ... um ... hmm ... let's see.
",53,3,21
"11434","Mom: [shouting] Any button! They all retaliate!
",53,3,21
"11435","Fry: Woo! Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him! [He laughs.] Now this is the high life; watching apes mangle each other near celebrities.
",53,3,21
"11436","Steve Castle: In my day we went to coke parties but the principle's the same.
",53,3,21
"11437","Calculon: Get your stinkin' trike off me, you damn dirty ape.
",53,3,21
"11438","Steve Castle: Listen, big guy, now that you're my protégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?
",53,3,21
"11439","Fry: Uh, work really, really hard?
",53,3,21
"11440","Steve Castle: No.
",53,3,21
"11441","Fry: Oh, thank God!
",53,3,21
"11442","Steve Castle: It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
",53,3,21
"11443","Fry: This company's on the fast track to the ""It"" list. Blast back kudos all around!
",53,3,21
"11444","Leela: Uh, hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over.
",53,3,21
"11445","Steve Castle: Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business. Image, people, image! Scope out this new ad!
",53,3,21
"11446","Mom: [on screen; in movie] We are all one, with one mind, one purpose and one act. Our enemies shall be eaten by squirrels. [The delivery woman starts spinning around.] We shall bow down and worship to ourselves. [The woman hurls the package at the screen.] We shall prevail!
",53,3,21
"11447","Man: [in movie] Hey! We were watching that!
",53,3,21
"11448","Leela: That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.

",53,3,21
"11450","Leela: Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?
",53,3,21
"11451","Fry: Yes I did, Leels. And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand.
",53,3,21
"11452","Leela: Oh, Lord!
",53,3,21
"11453","Zoidberg: This company's circling the drain, I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sandwich!
",53,3,21
"11454","Steve Castle: Sold!
",53,3,21
"11455","Zoidberg: A complete sangwich? [He laughs.] You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!

"11456","Mom: What is this moose drip? [She opens the magazines and holograms of Fry and Steve Castle wearing crowns appear under the headline ""The New Delivery Kings?"".] [reading] The new delivery kings? [talking] I'm sick of hearing about those turtle squirts!

"11469","Mom: Shut up, booger blaster! It's time the three of us had a talk.

"11477","Fry: What? I haven't changed. [He presses his intercom.] Suz? Have I changed?

"11480","Leela: I don't care what Ms. Johnson says. That Guy's turning this place into some kind of business.
",53,3,21
"11481","Farnsworth: This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more as a source of cheap labour, like a family.
",53,3,21
"11482","Fry: You're right, Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street. But we are a family and That Guy understands that.

"11535","Zoidberg: You had to drag spines into this!

"11536","Fry: [on screen] As vice chairman of Planet Express, I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now.
",53,3,21
"11537","Fry: So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?
",53,3,21
"11538","Steve Castle: Fry, I'm an 80's guy. Friendship to me means that for two bucks I'd beat you with a pool cue till you got detached retinas. The deal will go ahead as-- [His fingers and jaw suddenly twist. He screams. He falls to the floor and his bones crack and twist.] My bones!

"11542","Mom: Pry out his fillings, feed him to the jackals and let's get on with the sale.
",53,3,21
"11543","Fry: I don't think so. 'Cause, as vice chairman of the company, I gain voting control of his shares.

",54,3,22
"11565","Morbo: [shouting; on TV] I will destroy her! [talking] And now, extend a formulaic greeting to master chef Elzar. [The sound of cheering is heard and Morbo walks into a studio kitchen where Elzar smiles and waves.] So, uh, Elzar, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?
",54,3,22
"11566","Elzar: [on TV] Morbo, I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond, with mango chutney.

"11567","Morbo: [on TV] Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe!
",54,3,22
"11568","Fry: Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?
",54,3,22
"11569","Bender: Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends.
",54,3,22

",54,3,22
"11573","Leela: Nice!
",54,3,22
"11574","Farnsworth: Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring.

"11576","Farnsworth: Get--! [He snatches it away.] For the last time, Zoidberg, look with your eyes, not with your claws.

",54,3,22
"11579","Farnsworth: Oh, God! My tract!
",54,3,22
"11580","Fry: He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
",54,3,22
"11581","Leela: Alright, don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks.
",54,3,22
"11582","Fry: Hurry!
",54,3,22
"11583","Farnsworth: Good idea!
",54,3,22
"11584","Zoidberg: What's the hold-up?
",54,3,22
"11585","Bender: Fleeing somewhere?
",54,3,22
"11586","Fry: With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.

",54,3,22
"11589","Zoidberg: Sure. Me.
",54,3,22
"11590","Farnsworth: Because I don't want you touching that thing.
",54,3,22
"11591","Zoidberg: I know that. [Farnsworth leaves and Zoidberg picks up the bottle.] Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg! [He wiggles his mouth flaps inside the bottle and breaks off part of the ship. He screams and cuts the bottle in half.] Oh, no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts! [He picks up some ""Strong Force Krazy Glue"" but squeezes the bottle too soon and the glue squirts all over him. He screams and steps back. He turns around and some lab equipment and a sign reading ""Zoidberg: Don't Touch!"" gets stuck to him.] Ow! What? Oh!
",54,3,22
"11592","Bender: Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony. [Everyone gasps. The pony leg on Amy's plate still has a horseshoe on the hoof.] Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove.
",54,3,22
"11593","Hermes: This is terrible!
",54,3,22
"11594","Farnsworth: Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table.
",54,3,22
"11595","Amy: Where does the other end come out?
",54,3,22
"11596","Farnsworth: You know, I'm not quite sure. [He peers into the wormhole. The food falls from above and onto his head.] Oh, dear me!
",54,3,22
"11597","Bender: The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?
",54,3,22
"11598","Zoidberg: Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally. [The clock goes off and the cuckoo hits Zoidberg in the face.] Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!

",54,3,22

",54,3,22
"11601","Fry: [from lounge] Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings...
",54,3,22
"11602","Fry: But this food actually tastes better as vomit!
",54,3,22
"11603","Leela: It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
",54,3,22
"11604","Bender: [crying] And this time I mean it.
",54,3,22
"11605","Bender: Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that. [He cries then looks up. He is standing outside Elzar's restaurant.] Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!
",54,3,22
"11606","Elzar: Absolutely not.
",54,3,22
"11607","Bender: But I watch your show. You owe me!
",54,3,22
"11608","Elzar: I owe you nothing! For starter's, your antenna's in my crotch. Also, I hate you. Finally, you can't cook for squat.

",54,3,22
"11610","Elzar: I hate you.

"11613","Zoidberg: Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca. [He cries then stops.] Wait! What would the robot do? [He thinks.] Frame someone!

"11614","Fry: What up?
",54,3,22
"11615","Fry: [singing] I'm walking on sunshine! [He hums and gargles.] Sunshine!

",54,3,22
"11619","Gus: A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.
",54,3,22
"11620","Bender: Oh, OK. I thought you said ""romo"".
",54,3,22
"11621","Dandy Jim: No offence intended, my filthy friend. In fact, why not join us and ride the space rails?
",54,3,22
"11622","Gus: Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that switching prism up ahead.
",54,3,22
"11623","Dandy Jim: We're going nearly the speed of light so, uh, roll when you land.
",54,3,22
"11624","Bender: Ow.
",54,3,22
"11625","Gus: Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest hobo jungle in the quadrant.
",54,3,22
"11626","Bender: I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon. [Someone puts a pie on a windowsill. The two hobos smell it and literally float towards it with the help of their jetpacks.] Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?
",54,3,22
"11627","Gus: Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest chef ever.
",54,3,22
"11628","Dandy Jim: His restaurant was so high-toned, the only way to get reservations was to create a parallel universe where you already had reservations.
",54,3,22
"11629","Gus: Yep. I once ate there back when I what was a senator.
",54,3,22
"11630","Bender: Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?
",54,3,22
"11631","Spargle: Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...
",54,3,22
"11632","Spargle: [voice-over] Down Home Country Kitchen Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the extreme soda company that sponsored the show decided it was too old-fashioned.
",54,3,22
"11633","Man: Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef who can attract today's younger more extreme cooking show viewer.
",54,3,22
"11634","Spargle: Elzar!
",54,3,22
"11635","Elzar: Get lost, old man! Bam!
",54,3,22
"11636","Spargle: Mein soufflé!
",54,3,22
"11637","Spargle: Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!
",54,3,22
"11638","Bender: That twizzler!
",54,3,22
"11639","Spargle: As for me, I went temporarily insane and vound up here, making pies out of shoes.
",54,3,22
"11640","Bender: My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
",54,3,22
"11641","Spargle: Interesting. You wish to become a cook, but as a robot you have no sense of taste.
",54,3,22
"11642","Bender: It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste.
",54,3,22
"11643","Spargle: You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavour. You could become the greatest chef ever.
",54,3,22
"11644","Bender: I could?
",54,3,22
"11645","Spargle: Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.
",54,3,22
"11646","Bender: Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
",54,3,22
"11647","Spargle: Bender, hear me well. I shall train you. But first, you must forget everything you know about cooking.
",54,3,22
"11648","Bender: Done.
",54,3,22
"11649","Farnsworth: That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle! What's that? Well hang on, I'll look.

"11650","Ricardo: [on phone] Ola? Professor? Qué pasa?
",54,3,22
"11651","Farnsworth: I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker.
",54,3,22
"11652","Zoidberg: I'm acting astonished.
",54,3,22
"11653","Farnsworth: Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own ... Philip J. Fry!
",54,3,22
"11654","Fry: What?
",54,3,22
"11655","Farnsworth: Oh, it was a brilliant scheme. But you made one fatal mistake ... leaving this confession note.
",54,3,22
"11656","Zoidberg: Fry, you scoundrel!
",54,3,22
"11657","Fry: Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself.
",54,3,22
"11658","Farnsworth: Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials: $10.

",54,3,22

",54,3,22
"11667","Spargle: [hoarse] Because ... my stomach is about to explode.
",54,3,22
"11668","Bender: What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!
",54,3,22
"11669","Spargle: [hoarse] Oh, it hurts. But don't lose confidence. The important thing is that you defeat Elzar after I am gone. [He takes something out of his pocket.] And using this, you cannot fail.
",54,3,22
"11670","Bender: A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
",54,3,22
"11671","Spargle: [hoarse] No. It is the essence of pure flavour. A few drops will cause the inner perfection of any dish to blossom forth. [His stomach explodes.] Oh! There goes my ... life.

"11675","Elzar: Why, you--
",54,3,22
"11676","Bender: Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says [hoarse] ""Ooh, I'm dead!""
",54,3,22
"11677","Elzar: Spargle, huh? What he do, bland himself to death?
",54,3,22
"11678","Bender: No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
",54,3,22
"11679","Elzar: OK, but it seems like you're the one who killed him.
",54,3,22
"11680","Bender: Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
",54,3,22
"11681","Customer: Scandalous!
",54,3,22
"11682","Elzar: Very well. We'll meet on the ancient televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum. Whosever meal is best will claim the title of Iron Cook.

Hiroki talks to a woman in a green suit with a microphone.] Aki, what's Elzar making?
",54,3,22
"11697","Aki: Well, Hiroki-san, when I asked him, he asked what business it was of mine and conjectured that my mother was a prostitute.
",54,3,22
"11698","Stewart: In the English countryside many prostitutes decorate their rooms with festive gourds.

"11699","Female Announcer: [voice-over] 30 minutes to go.

"11701","Tate: I've never seen such confident, powerful strokes of the ass!
",54,3,22
"11702","Stewart: You've never seen mine!
",54,3,22
"11703","Tate: [sexfully] No, I haven't!
",54,3,22
"11704","Female Announcer: [voice-over] Fifteen minutes remaining.
",54,3,22
"11705","Hiroki: The iron cook is bringing in his signature creation, a working pastry replica of downtown Venice.
",54,3,22
"11706","Man: [shouting] Commemorative turkey basters. Get your commemorative turkey basters.
",54,3,22
"11707","Fry: Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything. [He open his wallet but it is empty.] Oh, right. Never mind.
",54,3,22
"11708","Zoidberg: Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!
",54,3,22
"11709","Female Announcer: [voice-over] Fifteen seconds.
",54,3,22

",54,3,22
"11711","Female Announcer: [voice-over] Ten seconds.
",54,3,22
"11712","Bender: Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you.
",54,3,22
"11713","Koji: Time uperuu!
",54,3,22
"11714","Hiroki: The iron cook Neptunian has gone all out to please the judges. He's even garnished the salad with $100 bills. Let's see what they think.
",54,3,22
"11715","Tate: Mmm. Soylent green is my kind of people!
",54,3,22
"11716","Morbo: Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in his sack for future digestion.
",54,3,22
"11717","Stewart: I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. It's a good thing.
",54,3,22
"11718","Hiroki: Next up, challenger Bender. A student of the legendary Helmut Spargle, Bender is some sort of wonderful mechanical man.
",54,3,22
"11719","Stewart: Ooh, delicious!
",54,3,22
"11720","Tate: This food looks kind of funky, but it tastes kind of fun-kay!
",54,3,22
"11721","Morbo: The challenger's ugly food has shown us that even hideous things can be sweet on the inside.
",54,3,22
"11722","Hiroki: And now, judgement. The winner will become the new iron cook, the loser is doomed to scrub. [Dirty pots and pans are piled around a sink.] Whose confection will achieve perfection? Whose foodstuff will be the good stuff?
",54,3,22
"11723","Koji: Challengeruu Benderuu!
",54,3,22
"11724","Fry: Yay!
",54,3,22
"11725","Farnsworth: [shouting] That's my robot! I own him!
",54,3,22
"11726","Bender: You honour me, Chairman Koji.
",54,3,22
"11727","Koji: Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.
",54,3,22
"11728","Bender: Chairman-san, I came here with one goal: To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that.
",54,3,22
"11729","Elzar: No question.
",54,3,22
"11730","Bender: But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of ""Zinc Saucier"", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money.
",54,3,22
"11731","Zoidberg: Wait! Everyone must know: I broke the Professor's bottled ship. [The audience gasps.] And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend, Fry! [crying] I can never repay him his ten dollars, so I must take the only honourable path. What the killing myself. [He takes Koji's sword and rips his shirt open. More gasps.] Here I go, already. [He stabs himself but the sword crumples as it hits his shell.] Huh?
",54,3,22
"11732","Koji: Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!
",54,3,22
"11733","Zoidberg: Fry did it!
",54,3,22
"11734","Bender: And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid.
",54,3,22
"11735","Leela: Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV.
",54,3,22
"11736","Farnsworth: Hmm. Let me see that vial, Bender. [He takes it and puts it in a microwave-like machine. A readout prints and he looks at it and gasps.] Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was ... water. Ordinary water!
",54,3,22
"11737","Hermes: No!
",54,3,22
"11738","Fry: Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best.
",54,3,22
"11739","Farnsworth: Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.
",54,3,22
"11740","Bender: The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... ""confidence""?
",54,3,22
"11741","Leela: I'm in!
",54,3,22
"11742","Farnsworth: I do!
",54,3,22
"11743","Amy: Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega-sweet for party-boarding.
",55,4,1
"11744","Farnsworth: Indeed.
",55,4,1
"11745","Amy: Any calls while I was out?
",55,4,1
"11746","Leela: Yeah. You got a tele-sonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
",55,4,1
"11747","Amy: My Kiffie called? [She walks over to the screen. Kif is still on the line, drumming his fingers on the desk in front of him.] Kif?
",55,4,1
"11748","Kif: [on screen] Ooh, Amy, you're back. Another hour and I would have thought about hanging up.
",55,4,1
"11749","Amy: Why didn't you just leave a message, sweetie?
",55,4,1
"11750","Kif: [on screen] Well, um, I've left hundreds of messages with your answering machine but you never seem to get them.
",55,4,1
"11751","Amy: [shouting] Bender!
",55,4,1
"11752","Bender: Not my fault if you don't check me! [He pushes his flashing antenna down and a tape inside him rewinds.] Messages erased.
",55,4,1
"11753","Kif: [on screen] Oh, dearest, this long-distance relationship is too much to bear. [Zapp walks behind him, just about wearing a towel. He hums and rubs the towel between his legs.] When even an inch separates us, I quiver with misery. So you can imagine how I feel when it's a billion light years.
",55,4,1
"11754","Amy: [on screen] Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache.
",55,4,1
"11755","Zapp: [on screen] Lieutenant, some things came off me and clogged the drain, so if you could-- Oh, ho! What's this?
",55,4,1
"11756","Zapp: Well, well, well! Do my eyes believe me or is that my bosom-y swan, Leela?
",55,4,1
"11757","Leela: [on screen] Say again. You're breaking up!
",55,4,1
"11758","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7.
",55,4,1
"11759","Scruffy: Scruffy's rollin' out a large pill!
",55,4,1
"11760","Amy: You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way.
",55,4,1
"11761","Farnsworth: We could but we won't! It's a spaceship, damnit, not a prom limousine! [He growls.] If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome.
",55,4,1
"11762","Leela: This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.
",55,4,1
"11763","Bender: [muttering] I don't even breathe oxygen!
",55,4,1
"11764","Amy: [whispering] Here I come, Kif!
",55,4,1
"11765","Zapp: They jumped right out of their pants! [A klaxon goes off and the message ""Approaching Vessel: Collision Imminent"" appears on several screens.] Oh, what now? Activate glass window. [Kif lifts the projection screen up. The Planet Express ship flies towards them. Kif gasps.] Kif, I'm sensing a very sensual disturbance in the force. Prepare for ship-to-ship intimacy!
",55,4,1
"11766","Kif: Yes, sir, captain!
",55,4,1
"11767","Zapp: How 'bout I help you finish that dream you were having about me?
",55,4,1
"11768","Leela: OK. I was just at this part: Yah!
",55,4,1
"11769","Zapp: Uh, let's try that a little lower and a lot softer!
",55,4,1
"11770","Kif: Imagine you stowing away and stealing a licensed starship! Oh, it's so romantic it gives me the shivers!
",55,4,1
"11771","Amy: I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak.
",55,4,1
"11772","Kif: Oh, Amy, I can't stand having a whole universe between us. I've been thinking a lot about this and, well, would you move in with me?
",55,4,1
"11773","Amy: Here? But, uh, wouldn't it be crowded?
",55,4,1
"11774","Kif: No, no! It's really twice the size. You can use the floor and I'll have the ceiling. See?
",55,4,1
"11775","Amy: Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but I'm not ... [Kif falls from the ceiling.] ... sure if I--
",55,4,1
"11776","Kif: Hush! Before you answer, come thither.
",55,4,1
"11777","Kif: This is the Holo-Shed. It can simulate anything you desire, and nothing can hurt you. Except when it malfunctions and the holograms become real.
",55,4,1
"11778","Amy: Well, that probably won't happen this time.
",55,4,1
"11779","Kif: I wanted to show you what life would be like if we were together. Computer: Run program ""Kif 1"".
",55,4,1
"11780","Amy: This is so beautiful! [A pony gallops by.] Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already.
",55,4,1
"11781","Kif: Yes, I programmed it in for you. 4 million lines of BASIC! And if this isn't the life you want, how 'bout this? Run program ""Kif 2"".
",55,4,1
"11782","Amy: Oh, Kif!
",55,4,1
"11783","Kif: We could live here at the shore of the Tranquilibrius Sea in a timeshare. And I would pluck the moon from the sky just to see you smile. [He reaches up to the moon and tries to pull it down. He struggles. It starts to glide away from the shore, pulling him over the water.] Almost got it. It seems to be ... sort of ... stuck! [He falls into the water.] I love you! [The moon falls and hits him on the head. He splutters.] Run program ""Kif://3"".
",55,4,1
"11784","Amy: This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
",55,4,1
"11785","Kif: Amy, we could live in a bus station bathroom for all I care. As long as we're together, it'll feel like a castle to me.
",55,4,1
"11786","Amy: Kif, I'd love to live with you ... someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own. [The Holo-Shed crackles around them.] What was that?
",55,4,1
"11787","Kif: Oh, dear. I fear the Holo-Shed might be broken again. Well, as long as we don't cross paths with Attila the--
",55,4,1
"11788","Amy: Look! Spirit!
",55,4,1
"11789","Kif: And there's Professor Moriarty, Jack the Ripper, Evil Lincoln!
",55,4,1
"11790","Moriarty: Right-oh, gents, it's another simulation gone mad, so murder and mayhem, standard procedure!
",55,4,1
"11791","Jack the Ripper: Rampage!
",55,4,1
"11792","Evil Lincoln: [shouting] Real holographic-simulated Evil Lincoln is back!
",55,4,1
"11793","Kif: The Holo-Shed's on the fritz again! The characters turned real!
",55,4,1
"11794","Zapp: Damn. The last time that happened I got slapped with three paternity suits. [The holograms run in and everyone screams.] Listen up, history's greatest villains... [He holds up a large gun.] Get back into the Holo-Shed before I start blasting!
",55,4,1
"11795","Attila the Hun: Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
",55,4,1
"11796","Zapp: Spare me your space-age techno-babble, Attila the Hun!
",55,4,1
"11797","Bender: Hey!
",55,4,1
"11798","Amy: Kif! Hold on!
",55,4,1
"11799","Kif: I totally want to!
",55,4,1
"11800","Leela: Grab on!
",55,4,1
"11801","Fry: Over here!
",55,4,1
"11802","Kif: Please hold me!
",55,4,1
"11803","Bender: Have a good one! [He flies towards the hole. The holographic Moon bounces in, bounces across the bridge and plugs the hole. The wind stops and everyone hits the floor.] Oh, man!
",55,4,1
"11804","Zapp: After all that I could use some relaxation. I'll be in the Holo-Shed.
",55,4,1
"11805","McGee: Well, except for a few broken bones, some internal haemorrhaging and a partially barfed-up heart, everyone appears fine. [Everyone breathes sighs of relief.] Oh, and Kif is pregnant.
",55,4,1
"11806","Kif: Oh, joy!
",55,4,1
"11807","Kif: Amy, isn't it wonderful? I'm pregnant!
",55,4,1
"11808","Amy: Yes it's ... great. A great miracle.
",55,4,1
"11809","Leela: And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
",55,4,1
"11810","Bender: Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im! [He goes for Kif and everyone restrains him.] Come over here, Kif! You--
",55,4,1
"11811","Zapp: Look, I'm sure we're all a little unclear on how anyone gets pregnant. So, Kif, pray explain. And don't spare the dirty words where appropriate.
",55,4,1
"11812","Kif: Well, it's quite simple really. When one of my species experiences deep feelings of love we enter a so-called ""receptive state"".
",55,4,1
"11813","Zapp: You disgust me! Go on.
",55,4,1
"11814","Kif: At that point, our skin becomes a semi-permeable membrane, which allows the passage of genetic material. I held Amy's hand and voilà.
",55,4,1
"11815","Bender: Well, OK. But that better be all there is!
",55,4,1
"11816","Kif: Oh, Amy! You'll be a mother!
",55,4,1
"11817","Kif: What a wondrous affirmation of our love. And all from the touch of your hand.
",55,4,1
"11818","Fry: Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?
",55,4,1
"11819","Evil Lincoln: Indeed.
",55,4,1
"11820","Fry: Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
",55,4,1
"11821","Amy: Hey, yeah! I mean ... what about that, Kif?
",55,4,1
"11822","Kif: Well, I suppose I might have gotten pregnant that way. Or even from a toilet seat. Though that's impossible since I have a private washroom.
",55,4,1
"11823","Zapp: Ah, my home away from home. By the way, Kif, your flush seemed to be set on stun, not kill.
",55,4,1
"11824","Amy: Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am. But just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test.
",55,4,1
"11825","Bender: A test! I demand a test!
",55,4,1
"11826","Farnsworth: Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyser. But I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber. [Fry, Leela, Amy and Zapp walk into it.] Now to take a DNA sample. [He draws some liquid from Kif, making him deflate, then puts the liquid in a part of the machine.] When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!
",55,4,1
"11827","Bender: Faster! Faster!
",55,4,1
"11828","Farnsworth: Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom. [Zapp comes through the tube, gets stuck halfway and finally flies out and lands on Fry.] Nor is Captain Brannigan.
",55,4,1
"11829","Kif: Oh, thank you, merciful God!
",55,4,1
"11830","Farnsworth: Zoidberg? What the hell were you doing in there?
",55,4,1
"11831","Zoidberg: That's where I live. I have no home.
",55,4,1
"11832","Kif: Amy? But that means--
",55,4,1
"11833","Kif: Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class: ""No Glove, No Love"".
",55,4,1
"11834","Leela: Wow, this is all so confusing.
",55,4,1
"11835","Zapp: Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this? [crying] Stop testing our love!
",55,4,1
"11836","Kif: Please, Captain. I thank Leela for the DNA she gave me but, in my species, the true parent is the one who inspired the initial feeling of love. We call that person the ""smizmar"". And my smizmar is Amy.
",55,4,1
"11837","Zapp: So the toilet seat is like the uncle or something?
",55,4,1
"11838","Leela: Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
",55,4,1
"11839","Amy: That's OK. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar. [She presses her wrist machine and a calendar comes up in front of her.] Thursday: Baby shower, enter. [The calendar enters it in on Thursday the 4th.] Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. Set ""Motherhood Mode"".
",55,4,1
"11840","Leela: To motherhood.
",55,4,1
"11841","Bender: Zoidberg?
",55,4,1
"11842","Fry: You know, my face was stuck in a pizza.
",55,4,1
"11843","Amy: Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but--
",55,4,1
"11844","Mrs. Wong: Yeah, yeah. We don't care how squishy alien get pregnant. All we care is that we have grandchild now.
",55,4,1
"11845","Kif: You're very open-minded, Mrs. Wong.
",55,4,1
"11846","Mr. Wong: Hey! You call her ""Grandma"" now!
",55,4,1
"11847","Mrs. Wong: Call me Grandma like crazy! All the time!
",55,4,1
"11848","Fry: Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here.
",55,4,1
"11849","Zoidberg: Also Zoidberg!
",55,4,1
"11850","Fry: So let's open the gifts.
",55,4,1
"11851","Bender: Alright!
",55,4,1
"11852","Kif: I can't wait! Let's start with this one, from Bender.
",55,4,1
"11853","Bender: It's my booties from when I was a kid.
",55,4,1
"11854","Amy: Uh, they're already bronzed.
",55,4,1
"11855","Bender: They are bronze.
",55,4,1
"11856","Kif: And this one's from Leela. Oh, I just love the bow! I wonder what it is!
",55,4,1
"11857","Zapp: Yes, I wonder what we got you.
",55,4,1
"11858","Kif: It's a basket! F-For picnics?
",55,4,1
"11859","Leela: It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium.
",55,4,1
"11860","Hermes: You could use it for picnics.
",55,4,1
"11861","Mrs. Wong: Here, Amy. We get this one for you.
",55,4,1
"11862","Amy: Is it a new party board?
",55,4,1
"11863","Mrs. Wong: It's a board alright! An ironing board.
",55,4,1
"11864","Mr. Wong: We had your old party board converted now that you not be partying anymore.
",55,4,1
"11865","Amy: You-You trashed my party board?
",55,4,1
"11866","Mrs. Wong: Damn right! Now you're a mom, the only surfing you do is under a big wave of responsibility.
",55,4,1
"11867","Kif: Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life! You all brought such wonderful gifts. But the greatest gift--
",55,4,1
"11868","Bender: Mine!
",55,4,1
"11869","Kif: Is the bond I share with my smizmar, Amy. For soon, the quivering mass of life within me will depend on us both. [He rubs his bump.] Even now, I can sense it feeding, squirming, searching, questing. And shortly, it will rend my loins in twain, burst forth and pull us down, down, down into the deep, dark waters of commitment.
",55,4,1
"11870","Zoidberg: That's so beautiful!
",55,4,1
"11871","Amy: [crying] Yes, it's, it's-- [She shakes her head.] No! I can't do this!
",55,4,1
"11872","Bender: Oh, my God!
",55,4,1
"11873","Kif: Oh, how could Amy leave me? When will women learn to take responsibility for the children they've helped create? [His bump rumbles and he gasps.] The quickening! My time is near. I must return to my homeworld to perform the ancient birthing rites.
",55,4,1
"11874","Scruffy: Lemme know how that turns out.
",55,4,1
"11875","Kif: I must now embark on a perilous journey to give birth in precisely the same swamp in which I was born.
",55,4,1
"11876","Leela: If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA.
",55,4,1
"11877","Kif: No, Leela. Tradition demands that I make this journey with my smizmar. And since Amy isn't, here I must go it alone. Farewell, for we may never meet again.
",55,4,1
"11878","Kif: My scrapes feel a little better now.
",55,4,1
"11879","Bender: Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!
",55,4,1
"11880","Kif: It's a poisonous froad! No one move.
",55,4,1
"11881","Bender: I'm back, baby!
",55,4,1
"11882","Kif: Behold! The sacred ancestral birthing grounds of my family.
",55,4,1
"11883","Zapp: Smells like a jockstrap!
",55,4,1
"11884","Grand Midwife: I am the Grand Midwife.
",55,4,1
"11885","Fry: Hi!
",55,4,1
"11886","Kif: I am Kif, of the clan Kroker, come to bear my young.
",55,4,1
"11887","Grand Midwife: Then let the Tea of New Life be brewed. [She points to a large jug with a tea bag string hanging out of it.] As it is writ, ""and both shall lift the jug together"". Where is your smizmar?
",55,4,1
"11888","Kif: She's not with me.
",55,4,1
"11889","Grand Midwife: Oh, the sorrow. Oh, the shame. I'm sorry, I'm probably just making you feel worse.

",55,4,1
"11895","Grand Midwife: May the love I sense between you at this moment remain with you both through all your days. [Kif cries. The Midwife ladles some tea into a cup.] The Tea of New Life is ready. Let those whose love created this life speak each other's names, then drink.

",56,4,2

",56,4,2
"11935","Amy: Hey, Professor, what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?
",56,4,2
"11936","Farnsworth: That? It's, uh ... nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron.
",56,4,2
"11937","Hermes: It looks like toxic waste. [He sniffs.] And it smells like toxic waste.
",56,4,2
"11938","Fry: What does it taste like?
",56,4,2
"11939","Hermes: Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.
",56,4,2
"11940","Farnsworth: Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it.
",56,4,2
"11941","Hermes: I'm afraid I do. [He takes out his Federal Bureaucracy badge and Farnsworth gasps.] I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
",56,4,2

",56,4,2
"11943","Farnsworth: Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?
",56,4,2

",56,4,2
"11945","Bender: Alright, environment, you've met your match!
",56,4,2

",56,4,2
"11947","Vyolet: But he ruined my wedding dress.
",56,4,2
"11948","Bender: Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
",56,4,2
"11949","Vogel: Y'know, it's not easy being an orphan -- not if I have anything to do with it. [He chuckles to himself.] But today's honouree, Turanga Leela, has really made something of herself. [He smiles to Leela. She smiles back.] I'll never forget the night that cute little alien baby was abandoned on our doorstep. Because I have a photographic memory and I remember every night!
",56,4,2
"11950","Vogel: What the--? An alien language? I guess you're an alien. What a beautiful gigantic eye you ha-- [Leela kicks him.] Well, come on in.
",56,4,2
"11951","Vogel: From those humble beginnings, Leela went on to become a county-certified starship captain. And so it is my pleasure today to nail her picture alongside those of our most distinguished alumni.
",56,4,2
"11952","Leela: Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents...
",56,4,2
"11953","Vogel: [hammering] Give me a--
",56,4,2
"11954","Leela: I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--
",56,4,2
"11955","Vogel: There we are. Picture's up.
",56,4,2
"11956","Bender: [shouting] It's crooked!
",56,4,2
"11957","Leela: In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today.
",56,4,2
"11958","Kids: [chanting] Leela! Leela! Leela!
",56,4,2

",56,4,2
"11961","Vogel: That's it, Albert, no more espresso for you.
",56,4,2
"11962","Photographer: Mind if I get a picture of you with your picture for the news, ma'am?
",56,4,2
"11963","Leela: Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
",56,4,2
"11964","Fry: If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying.
",56,4,2
"11965","Leela: [crying] It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today.
",56,4,2
"11966","Fry: Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk.
",56,4,2
"11967","Leela: I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
",56,4,2
"11968","Fry: Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
",56,4,2
"11969","Leela: I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me.
",56,4,2
"11970","Fry: Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'.
",56,4,2
"11971","Leela: That's not even close to what I had in mind.
",56,4,2
"11972","Fry: Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you.
",56,4,2
"11973","Leela: I know. [They both look up at the stars.] Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.
",56,4,2
"11974","Fry: Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?
",56,4,2
"11975","Bender: My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
",56,4,2
"11976","Leela: Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!
",56,4,2
"11977","Bender: Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--
",56,4,2
"11978","Bender: [shouting] What did I do to deserve this?
",56,4,2
"11979","Dwayne: Behold, our once beautiful mutagenic sewage lake.
",56,4,2
"11980","Vyolet: The radioactive waste you dumped in it has made it bright enough to see how ugly we really are.
",56,4,2

",56,4,2
"11986","Fry: No fair!
",56,4,2
"11987","Bender: Bender's innocent!
",56,4,2
"11988","Raoul: The instant you touch these mutatious waters, your DNA will be forever altered, turning you into horrible mutants like us. Especially him! [He points at the leg mutant who sighs.] Allow me to demonstrate!
",56,4,2
"11989","Fry: It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
",56,4,2
"11990","Raoul: Submerge the prisoners.
",56,4,2
"11991","Bender: Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
",56,4,2
"11992","Dwayne: We're gonna beat you afterwards.

",56,4,2

",56,4,2

",56,4,2
"12005","Bender: What's this junk?
",56,4,2
"12006","Leela: It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life.
",56,4,2
"12007","Fry: That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
",56,4,2
"12008","Leela: And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
",56,4,2
"12009","Bender: And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
",56,4,2
"12010","Leela: It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!
",56,4,2
"12011","Fry: [whispering] Dude! Over here!
",56,4,2
"12012","Leela: It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
",56,4,2
"12013","Fry: And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings.
",56,4,2
"12014","Leela: [shivering] Oh, I'm scared! [She strokes her ponytail.] My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!
",56,4,2
"12015","Vyolet: [from outside] They must be in here.
",56,4,2
"12016","Raoul: [from outside] Yeah, after them.
",56,4,2
"12017","Bender: And then Bender ran!
",56,4,2
"12018","Fry: Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!
",56,4,2
"12019","Dwayne: Got you!
",56,4,2
"12020","Leg Mutant: Take this!
",56,4,2
"12021","Fry: Ow!
",56,4,2
"12022","Raoul: This time I'm calling for the death penalty. And not just because I'm running for re-election as Supreme Mutant.
",56,4,2
"12023","Mutants: [chanting] Four more years! Four more years!
",56,4,2
"12024","Raoul: Oh, very well. [He turns to the mutants.] Your attention. Instead of being tortured to death, the prisoners shall hereby be expelled from the sewers and never allowed to return.
",56,4,2
"12025","Bender: [sarcastic] Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?
",56,4,2
"12026","Leela: Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
",56,4,2
"12027","Bender: Yeah! What are you chicken?
",56,4,2
"12028","Fry: [whispering] Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!
",56,4,2
"12029","Raoul: They'll need transportation to the surface. Bring in the airship.
",56,4,2
"12030","Bender: Ew!
",56,4,2
"12031","Raoul: We constructed it from the remnants of old discarded Macy's parade balloons. Underdog's groin, Bart Simpson's left ear and right shin, Garfield's owner Jon's forehead.
",56,4,2

",56,4,2
"12039","Leela: [shouting] Don't worry! I'll be fine! [She looks down again.] [talking] They know something about me and I've got to find out what. [She swan dives off the ladder, into the sewage. She appears to emerge as a mutant with an octopus head. She takes the octopus off and looks at her reflection.] The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?
",56,4,2
"12040","Octopus: It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.
",56,4,2
"12041","Leela: Eurgh! [She throws the octopus back into the sewage, turns and sees the hooded figures. She gasps.] Who the hell are you?
",56,4,2
"12042","Hooded Figure #1: No one. And watch your language, young lady!
",56,4,2
"12043","Mutant #2: Stop right there! I don't want to hurt you. [Leela kicks him over.] I didn't want you to hurt me either!
",56,4,2
"12044","Fry: Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
",56,4,2
"12045","Vogel: Nah. Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
",56,4,2
"12046","Fry: That's impossible because my time is worthless!
",56,4,2
"12047","Vogel: Huh. Well then there is one thing. [He pulls out a file.] It's the note I found with Leela the day she was abandoned. But it's written in Alienese, so no one on Earth can translate it. Not even Brainzilla.
",56,4,2
"12048","Fry: Hand it over.
",56,4,2
"12049","Vogel: Sure. [He hands Fry the paper.] I just wish I could be more helpful. Would you like some dirt on any other orphans?
",56,4,2
"12050","Fry: Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later.
",56,4,2
"12051","Fry: Can you translate it?
",56,4,2
"12052","Farnsworth: Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex there's even less chance of understanding it.
",56,4,2
"12053","Fry: I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
",56,4,2
"12054","Farnsworth: Very well.
",56,4,2
"12055","Fry: Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
",56,4,2
"12056","Farnsworth: It can do other things. Why shouldn't it? [He throws the switch.] Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message, there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years.
",56,4,2
"12057","Fry: Is it done?
",56,4,2
"12058","Farnsworth: Certainly not. Two dings means it's done. [Two dings.] But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
",56,4,2
"12059","Leela: Where did they go?
",56,4,2
"12060","Bender: Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy.
",56,4,2
"12061","Leela: Ew!
",56,4,2
"12062","Farnsworth: That's it! It's done! [Fry gasps.] I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now.
",56,4,2
"12063","Doctor: It's a girl.
",56,4,2
"12064","Mother: My God! She's beautiful. No extra anythings.
",56,4,2
"12065","Father: Good people skills!
",56,4,2
"12066","Mother: She's completely perfect!
",56,4,2
"12067","Doctor: In my professional opinion as an ear, ear, ear, nose and throat doctor, she is the least-mutated mutant ever born.
",56,4,2
"12068","Father: And yet she's cursed to live the horrible degrading life of a mutant. Like all of us. Especially him!
",56,4,2
"12069","Leg Mutant: It's true!
",56,4,2
"12070","Mother: Maybe we can do better for her.
",56,4,2
"12071","Father: I made this bracelet so that in some small way we'll always be with you, even when it doesn't seem like it. During your entire life, for example.
",56,4,2
"12072","Mother: You won't pass for human, cutie. But if my PhD in exo-linguistics is worth diddly-poop, this note should convince them you're an alien. [She attaches the note to the baby's blanket.] And that'll be enough to give you a real life.
",56,4,2
"12073","Father: She'll never know we're her parents.
",56,4,2
"12074","Mother: That's our gift to her. Better we should die than have her learn the shameful truth of her origin.
",56,4,2
"12075","Father: I'm with you.

",56,4,2
"12082","Leela: What is all this? [She points to the wall with all her pictures on it.] Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!

"12083","Hooded Figure #2: Well, actually, there--
",56,4,2
"12084","Hooded Figure #1: Morris! Sh!
",56,4,2
"12085","Leela: [angry] And what about this [She pulls a bracelet off one of them. She compares it to her own.] How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!
",56,4,2
"12086","Hooded Figure #2: [sombre] Yes. We killed them.
",56,4,2
"12087","Hooded Figure #1: You guessed the truth.

",56,4,2
"12094","Munda: Yes.
",56,4,2
"12095","Fry: I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you.
",56,4,2
"12096","Leela: What does it say?
",56,4,2
"12097","Fry: I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
",56,4,2
"12098","Munda: It says, ""Your parents love you very much"".
",56,4,2
"12099","Morris: We still do.
",56,4,2
"12100","Leela: So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant.
",56,4,2

",57,4,3
"12109","Bender: Why not, indeed?
",57,4,3
"12110","Leela: Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually.

"12111","Bender: Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.

"12117","Farnsworth: We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer, Romanticorp.
",57,4,3
"12118","Amy: Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
",57,4,3
"12119","Hermes: Very good, Amy!
",57,4,3
"12120","Farnsworth: Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
",57,4,3
"12121","Farnsworth: Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting.

"12122","Leela: Check!
",57,4,3
"12123","Sheldon: Welcome. Oh, I'm just so excited! [They both kiss.] I'm Sheldon, and this is my chief financial officer, Gwen.
",57,4,3
"12124","Gwen: For 30 years we've shared the adventure of managing Romanticorp.
",57,4,3
"12125","Sheldon: Not to mention the adventure of marriage.
",57,4,3
"12126","Leela: Oh, you have got to be kidding! [Farnsworth shocks her with a cattle prod.] Ow! I-I mean, ""Aww! That's so sweet!"" [He shocks her again.] Ow! I mean, ""Aww dat's show shweet!""
",57,4,3
"12127","Farnsworth: You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?
",57,4,3
"12128","Leela: Yeah, sure.

",57,4,3
"12130","Sheldon: Do any of you collect Lovey Bears?
",57,4,3

",57,4,3
"12132","Gwen: No.
",57,4,3
"12133","Sheldon: It's actually cheaper to genetically engineer real ones. [They pass some Lovey Bears on a grassy area.] They frolic in the Lovey Forest until their first birthday. Then we choose the cuddly-uddliest ones and stuff them full of fire-retardant love fluff!

",57,4,3
"12140","Hermes: Impressive!
",57,4,3
"12141","Gwen: My family has been making these hearts since the 1900s. Tastes may have changed but our secret recipe sure hasn't.
",57,4,3
"12142","Fry: Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are"". Here, Leela, ""U-R-2 Cute"".
",57,4,3
"12143","Leela: Perhaps. What's your point?
",57,4,3
"12144","Fry: I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them.
",57,4,3
"12145","Farnsworth: So, do we have the contract?
",57,4,3
"12146","Farnsworth: With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about.
",57,4,3
"12147","Leela: Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor.
",57,4,3
"12148","Fry: And you got a cage for the lion!
",57,4,3
"12149","Bender: Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!
",57,4,3
"12150","Farnsworth: Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed.
",57,4,3
"12151","Ship: Yeah, it was me. It's a cute song.
",57,4,3
"12152","Bender: Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!
",57,4,3
"12153","Farnsworth: It even comes with an adjustable voice.
",57,4,3
"12154","Ship: [male voice] We each get one of the four buttons. [female voice] Remember, Bender? That was the deal.
",57,4,3
"12155","Bender: What? Did you just say--
",57,4,3
"12156","Ship: If you don't like the stations you could just ... play with my buttons till you find something we both enjoy. [Bender growls sexfully.] Oh, gosh! That came out all wrong!
",57,4,3
"12157","Bender: Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?
",57,4,3
"12158","Fry: Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you. [He picks up a handful.] ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooh, so close!
",57,4,3
"12159","Leela: I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry, I'm impressed by the guy. Or not.
",57,4,3
"12160","Fry: Whoa!
",57,4,3
"12161","Leela: What was that?
",57,4,3
"12162","Fry: Maybe we hit a space cow.
",57,4,3
"12163","Bender: Coochie, coochie!
",57,4,3
"12164","Ship: [giggling] Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
",57,4,3

",57,4,3

",57,4,3
"12167","Leela: Bender! [Bender panics.] What's going on in here? [She gasps.] Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame.
",57,4,3
"12168","Ship: It's not what it looks like. Uh, Bender was just helping me ... zip up my turbine.
",57,4,3
"12169","Fry: Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--
",57,4,3
"12170","Bender: Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty.
",57,4,3
"12171","Leela: Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B.
",57,4,3
"12172","Bender: That's what makes it so nasty!
",57,4,3
"12173","Leela: Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking.

It won't be a stylish marriage,

",57,4,3
"12177","Bender: But you'll look sweet,

",57,4,3
"12178","Bender: Well, I'm sick of her.
",57,4,3
"12179","Fry: The ship? But you just started dating.
",57,4,3
"12180","Bender: With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans.
",57,4,3
"12181","Leela: Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
",57,4,3
"12182","Bender: In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side.
",57,4,3
"12183","Fry: You have much to teach us.
",57,4,3
"12184","Leela: Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
",57,4,3
"12185","Bender: Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder.
",57,4,3
"12186","Fembot #1: What's it like being a lawyer for the Mayor's office and also the world's strongest millionaire?
",57,4,3
"12187","Bender: Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!
",57,4,3
"12188","Elzar: Good evening, Bender. And to your lady friends may I say, ""Bam""!
",57,4,3
"12189","Fembot #2: You know Elzar?
",57,4,3
"12190","Ship: Hm.
",57,4,3
"12191","Fry: Huh? [He gets up and presses a button by the window. It slides up, revealing Ship hovering outside. Fry rubs his eyes.] Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
",57,4,3
"12192","Ship: Oh. Hi, Fry. Is Bender home?
",57,4,3
"12193","Fry: Uh, no. Um, I think he's at his parents'.
",57,4,3
"12194","Ship: Oh, I see. He didn't fly there in another spaceship did he?
",57,4,3
"12195","Fry: Bender? No! He's an old-fashioned one-spaceship robot. Look, I'll tell him you stopped by, K?
",57,4,3
"12196","Ship: OK. [Fry closes the window and walks back to his bed. Almost immediately the bell rings again. He opens the window and Ship is still there.] Oh. Hi, Fry. Is he home now?
",57,4,3
"12197","Ship: Of all the zoos we've been to today, I like this one the best. Bender, which is your favourite nocturnal rat?
",57,4,3
"12198","Bender: Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive.
",57,4,3
"12199","Ship: Oh, honey, look! The tapirs! [Bender sighs and walks over.] It says here the babies lose their pyjama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?
",57,4,3
"12200","Bender: Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!
",57,4,3
"12201","Ship: Bender! Are you looking at other women?
",57,4,3
"12202","Bender: No, baby, never!
",57,4,3
"12203","Ship: Bender, don't lie! I saw you at Elzar's with those two ladies of the evening. Explain that!
",57,4,3
"12204","Bender: OK, I like a challenge. [muttering] No ... no. [talking] Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants.
",57,4,3
"12205","Ship: Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I do.
",57,4,3
"12206","Bender: Phew!
",57,4,3
"12207","Ship: I'm gonna go home and get dinner started.
",57,4,3
"12208","Liu: Who are you talking to?
",57,4,3
"12209","Bender: No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender.
",57,4,3
"12210","Liu: I love you--
",57,4,3
"12211","Leela: Planet Express Ship, is something wrong?
",57,4,3
"12212","Ship: Oh, it's Bender. He's acting so strange lately. [She gasps.] Do you think he's going to ask me to marry him?
",57,4,3
"12213","Leela: Uh, no.
",57,4,3
"12214","Ship: Oh, somebody knows something she's not telling!
",57,4,3
"12215","Leela: Look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's, y'know, not that great?
",57,4,3
"12216","Ship: You're just jealous. No one loves you cause you're tiny and you're made of meat.
",57,4,3
"12217","Leela: Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
",57,4,3
"12218","Ship: Sorry, Captain Leela. I guess I'm just having one of those manic Mondays!
",57,4,3
"12219","Lrrr: This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?
",57,4,3
"12220","Nd-Nd: Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.
",57,4,3
"12221","Guard: Exalted leaders, the Earth messengers have arrived bearing a peace offering from their weak and fearful government.
",57,4,3
"12222","Lrrr: Oh, very well. This is a Joey-heavy episode anyway. [He turns the TV off. Enter Leela, Fry and Bender with the barrels of candy hearts.] I am Lrrr of the planet Omicron Persei 8.

",57,4,3
"12225","Nd-Nd: And what is this emotion you humans call ""wuv""?
",57,4,3
"12226","Lrrr: Surely it says ""love""?
",57,4,3
"12227","Nd-Nd: No, ""wuv"". With an Earth ""W"". Behold!
",57,4,3
"12228","Lrrr: [shouting] This concept of ""wuv"" confuses and infuriates us!
",57,4,3
"12229","Fry: Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell!
",57,4,3
"12230","Leela: Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets.
",57,4,3
"12231","Bender: Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends.
",57,4,3
"12232","Ship: [screaming] Nooo!
",57,4,3
"12233","Bender: So we're cool?
",57,4,3
"12234","Leela: Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage.
",57,4,3
"12235","Ship: [crying] No damage? What about my feelings?
",57,4,3
"12236","Leela: Aw, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are.
",57,4,3
"12237","Bender: [singing] Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!
",57,4,3
"12238","Fry: You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!
",57,4,3
"12239","Bender: Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
",57,4,3
"12240","Leela: I know. I know. Look, Ship, if there's one thing I learned from my mutual break-up with Sean that was totally mutual, it's that happiness can only come from within you.
",57,4,3
"12241","Ship: [crying] But Bender is within me! There must be some way to make him love me again.
",57,4,3
"12242","Leela: Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
",57,4,3
"12243","Ship: That is so true. [She changes course.] I may not be able to change the laws of time and space, but I know something that can.
",57,4,3
"12244","Leela: Um, sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left.
",57,4,3
"12245","Ship: [à la HAL] I'm afraid I can't do that, Leela.
",57,4,3
"12246","Fry: What's happening? Space cow?
",57,4,3
"12247","Leela: The ship's just taking the break-up a little hard. [whispering] She's nuts!
",57,4,3
"12248","Ship: In a few moments, the power of 10 billion black holes will smush me and Bender together into a beautiful eternal quantum singularity.
",57,4,3
"12249","Bender: Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff.
",57,4,3
"12250","Ship: Hmm. I don't believe you. If you really wanted to be with me, you'd merge your programming with mine.
",57,4,3
"12251","Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship.
",57,4,3
"12252","Leela: Look, I don't know if you want my opinion--
",57,4,3
"12253","Ship: Leela, Bender and I really need to be alone, so I'm turning off the oxygen.
",57,4,3
"12254","Leela: Now look, missy! If you don't turn around now, I'm going to have to shut down your brain.
",57,4,3
"12255","Ship: Fire detected in the vicinity of Leela.
",57,4,3
"12256","Fry: Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
",57,4,3
"12257","Ship: Maybe not. But what if the artificial gravity were to malfunction?
",57,4,3
"12258","Bender: Float for your lives!
",57,4,3
"12259","Leela: This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
",57,4,3
"12260","Fry: Same as everyday, got it.
",57,4,3
"12261","Leela: Now, here's the plan.
",57,4,3
"12262","Ship: Oh, if only I could read lips.
",57,4,3
"12263","Leela: Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain.
",57,4,3
"12264","Bender: It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!
",57,4,3
"12265","Leela: I'm willing to take that risk.
",57,4,3
"12266","Bender: Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable.
",57,4,3
"12267","Ship: You really mean it?
",57,4,3
"12268","Bender: Uh... [He looks at his hand. ""Yes"" is written on it.] Yes!
",57,4,3
"12269","Bender: Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
",57,4,3
"12270","Ship: Come closer, Bender. Let's become one!
",57,4,3
"12271","Bender: I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!
",57,4,3
"12272","Leela: OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix. [The carbonated logic matrix looks like several fizzy drinks cans. She opens one of them and grunts.] I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face.
",57,4,3
"12273","Fry: I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
",57,4,3
"12274","Leela: Fat chance.
",57,4,3
"12275","Fry: Yeah, I know [He eats one of the hearts and makes a disgusted noise.] Ooh! How 'bout this one?
",57,4,3
"12276","Leela: Give it up, Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order.
",57,4,3
"12277","Leela: Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now.
",57,4,3
"12278","Ship: Want ... engulf ... Bender!
",57,4,3
"12279","Leela: Only a few more. [She pops another one.] Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
",57,4,3
"12280","Fry: Um, Leela?
",57,4,3
"12281","Leela: Fry! I'll read your candy later, when we're not dead! [Fry takes in a last puff of air and connects his oxygen supply to Leela's mask.] What was that?

"12282","Fry: [suffocating] Oh, nothing.
",57,4,3
"12283","Ship: We're gonna love being each other, you sexy ion!

",57,4,3
"12286","Leela: It worked! Gravity normal, air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it, Fry! [She looks over and sees his lifeless body.] Fry? [She sees her oxygen supply is at zero and her face mask is connected to Fry's tank and gasps.] You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe! [She turns him over and tries to resuscitate him. He coughs and spits out a candy heart. It sticks to her cheek. She takes it off.] [reading] You leave me breathless. [Fry smiles.] [talking] Happy Valentine's Day, Fry.

"12287","Fry: [gasping] Happy Valentine's day.

",57,4,3
"12289","Bender: Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?
",57,4,3
"12290","Leela: Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers.
",57,4,3
"12291","Bender: Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle. [Ship's voice] A cuddly baby tapir! [normal] And that's why I love him!
",57,4,3
"12292","Fry: Well, I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts.
",57,4,3
"12293","Leela: Nah, I've got a lazier idea.
",57,4,3
"12294","Zoidberg: [voice-over] As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays, but not be destroyed by them: Earth. So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg! And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!

"12314","Bender: Ah, there. Finished. And with only six missing pieces!
",58,4,4
"12315","Fry: Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
",58,4,4
"12316","Leela: Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with Mighty Thor.

"12318","Zoidberg: I've got just the thing: Genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman. [Fry and Leela squeeze some onto their hands and rub it on themselves.] ""Come one, come all,"" he said. ""Step right up!"" ""This sounds too good to be true,"" I thought. He said I looked like a smart, young man. ""So is it a deal?"" I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream--

"12331","Leela: How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
",58,4,4

",58,4,4
"12346","Leela: To have parents.
",58,4,4
"12347","Fry: Whatever. The correct answer is: To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
",58,4,4
"12348","Leela: Hmm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!
",58,4,4

",58,4,4
"12350","Bender: Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers.

",58,4,4
"12353","Bender: Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed. [He starts walking back up the steps.] See you. With two humans, you'd think there'd be a robot in there to balance things out but whatever. [He opens his chest cabinet.] I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away.
",58,4,4
"12354","Leela: We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?
",58,4,4
"12355","Fry: Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot.
",58,4,4
"12356","Bender: So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this. [He reaches over to the other end of the hangar, grabs a bottle of beer, retracts his arm and hands the bottle to Fry.] Also I got this going.

"12382","Leela: Especially from everybody.
",58,4,4
"12383","Fry: Give several reasons why.
",58,4,4

",58,4,4
"12385","Fry: Or do we? No, I guess not.
",58,4,4
"12386","Leela: Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones.
",58,4,4

",58,4,4
"12392","Poopenmeyer: Uh, they're usually here by now.
",58,4,4

[The court ""boos"".] Yet I would gladly eat a flag myself, had I not used my intestine as a rope to hoist a flag made of my own skin, if it would protect the freedoms of the proud people who salute that flag.

"12714","Cubert: Um, we're 12. So, yes.
",60,4,6
"12715","Dwight: Hold up, Cubert. You're a clone of the Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?
",60,4,6
"12716","Cubert: Um, duh!
",60,4,6
"12717","Dwight: ""Duh"" what?
",60,4,6
"12718","Cubert: Dad? Do I have a birthday?
",60,4,6
"12719","Farnsworth: Hmm. You didn't have a birth so, technically, no. [Cubert sighs. Farnsworth puts his hand on his shoulder.] Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank, or the day I scraped your DNA from that growth on my back.
",60,4,6
"12720","Cubert: Ooh! That one!
",60,4,6
"12721","Farnsworth: Ah, yes. It was 13 years ago next week. [He takes something out of his lab coat.] I used this very fork.
",60,4,6
"12722","Hermes: Aw, well isn't that-- Ew!
",60,4,6
"12723","Dwight: Hey! Next week'll be my birthday too.
",60,4,6
"12724","Hermes: That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The way I just said!
",60,4,6

",60,4,6
"12726","Dwight: Way to go, Pops!
",60,4,6
"12727","Bender: [shouting; from lounge] Something's happening on television.

"12728","Calculon: [on TV] Oh, Monique, why did we wait so many years to bathe in champagne?
",60,4,6
"12729","Antonio: [on TV] Father, I've discovered the shocking secret mother has kept from you for 200 years.
",60,4,6
"12730","Monique: [on TV] No! No!
",60,4,6
"12731","Antonio: [on TV] Brace yourself. For when I speak these words, you may well suffer an attack of explosive amnesia. For you see, the horrible secret is--
",60,4,6
"12732","Bender: Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
",60,4,6
"12733","Sal: He's busteds. Let's get hims outta heres.
",60,4,6
"12734","Announcer: [voice-over; on TV] We now join America's most popular show already in progress, Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.

"12736","Zoidberg: Look who's here, everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!
",60,4,6
"12737","Leela: Since when are you performing at children's parties?
",60,4,6
"12738","Zoidberg: Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes--
",60,4,6
"12739","Dwight: This party pukes.
",60,4,6
"12740","Cubert: Yeah! The guests were supposed to be here three hours ago.
",60,4,6
"12741","Farnsworth: Well, that doesn't mean that no one is coming or that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?
",60,4,6
"12742","Dwight: Alright! They must have all come as a group.
",60,4,6
"12743","Cubert: Welcome, swingers! Pull up a groove and get fabulous.
",60,4,6
"12744","Tinny Tim: Good day, fellows. Someone dumped this invitation in my begging cup. Happy growth-scraping day to all!
",60,4,6
"12745","Hermes: Fire 'em all.
",60,4,6
"12746","Farnsworth: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
",60,4,6
"12747","Bender: [gasping] Guys! Guys! Something's happening on television again.
",60,4,6
"12748","Morbo: [on TV] Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion Tonite. Across the galaxy, my people are completing the mighty space fleet that will exterminate the human race! But first, this news from Tinseltown.
",60,4,6
"12749","Linda: [on TV] Following Antonio Calculon Jr.'s breakdown on the set, the popular TV show All My Circuits will hold an open casting call for child robots to replace him.
",60,4,6
"12750","Bender: An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
",60,4,6
"12751","Tinny Tim: What's that, sir?
",60,4,6
"12752","Bender: That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!
",60,4,6
"12753","Tinny Tim: You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, sir. [He raises his crutch.] Bravo!
",60,4,6
"12754","Leela: Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here.
",60,4,6
"12755","Fry: Look! There's Macaulay Culkon.
",60,4,6
"12756","Leela: He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
",60,4,6
"12757","Fry: Pst. There's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed a convenience store!
",60,4,6
"12758","Leela: And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!

",60,4,6
"12761","Mombot: Hold on, precious. Let's make you look nice for the lady. [She smoothes his ""hair"" down and opens his chest cabinet, revealing wires.] What's this? [She snaps the wires out.] What did I tell you? [She whips him with every word.] No more hanging wires!
",60,4,6
"12762","Casting Director: In this scene, you've just found out your real father is Calculon's fourth evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. OK ... take us there!
",60,4,6
"12763","Emotitron Jr.: Now that I know the truth, Father, I must ride south and join the robo-bandidos at Veracruz.
",60,4,6
"12764","Bender: [shouting; from outside] Awful! Boo! This kid sucks! We want Bender! Boo!
",60,4,6
"12765","Calculon: Well, I thought he was good but the audience seems to have turned on him.
",60,4,6
"12766","Casting Director: But I don't think--
",60,4,6
"12767","Calculon: Next!
",60,4,6
"12768","Macaulay Culkon: --At Veracruz. So, if you'll kindly hand me my poncho--
",60,4,6
"12769","Bender: [shouting; from outside] Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest!
",60,4,6
"12770","Calculon: Sorry, kid. You're flailing up there. [He screams and runs out.] 90 actors and they all got boo-ed. I just wish we could get this Bender I keep hearing about. They say he's the greatest.
",60,4,6
"12771","Casting Director: Well, there is a robot named Bender here but he's much too old for--
",60,4,6
"12772","Calculon: Send him in forthwith!
",60,4,6
"12773","Bender: [shouting] Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
",60,4,6
"12774","Casting Director: Mr. Bender?
",60,4,6
"12775","Casting Director: Have you ever been on TV before?
",60,4,6
"12776","Bender: Once, when I took those hostages.
",60,4,6
"12777","Calculon: I saw that! You were good. Let's hear you audition.
",60,4,6
"12778","Bender: Bandidos, eh? Aw, this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent! [He clears his throat.] [bad Spanish accent] I will see. Adios Padre! Come, Jesus, my faithful ... chee-huey-hua. Tonight we eat ... gee-wack-a-mole by the El Rio!
",60,4,6
"12779","Calculon: That was so terrible I think you gave me cancer! I don't care how popular you are. You will never work on my show!
",60,4,6
"12780","Fry: [shouting; from outside] Yay, Bender!
",60,4,6
"12781","Leela: [shouting; from outside] We demand Bender!
",60,4,6
"12782","Calculon: However, you've got the job. Welcome aboard, son!
",60,4,6
"12783","Bender: Father-o!
",60,4,6
"12784","Calculon: Bender, I'd like you to meet our director ... [He pulls a man with a ponytail and wearing a blernsball cap in front of him.] ... whose name I never learned.
",60,4,6
"12785","Bender: Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
",60,4,6
"12786","Director: Uh, don't worry about the script, baby. We re-wrote your part to better suit your acting abilities.
",60,4,6
"12787","Bender: So now my character has a British accent?
",60,4,6
"12788","Director: No, now your character's in a coma. Get in bed and don't move. [He moves off the set behind the cameras. Bender grumbles and hops onto the bed and lies down.] And ... action!
",60,4,6
"12789","Bender: [muttering] Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British.
",60,4,6
"12790","Calculon: Alas that mine only son should sink into an irreversible, permanent ... coma.
",60,4,6
"12791","Bender: [quietly] Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
",60,4,6
"12792","Calculon: Curse the tragic wildebeest accident that--
",60,4,6
"12793","Bender: Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut. [He stands up on the bed and starts dancing.] C'mon, baby! [He hums and takes a cigar out of his chest cabinet and takes a few puffs then follows with a gulp of beer.] Come on!
",60,4,6
"12794","Calculon: I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
",60,4,6
"12795","Bender: Bite my shiny metal ass! [He carries on dancing.] Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
",60,4,6
"12796","Director: [shouting] Cut! [He walks onto the set.] That's the worst coma acting I've ever seen. We'll have to shoot it again.
",60,4,6
"12797","Calculon: No! No, no, no. I don't do two takes.
",60,4,6
"12798","Director: But this guy was--
",60,4,6
"12799","Calculon: Amateurs like you do two takes. I do one take. Print it. I'll be in my three-storey trailer.
",60,4,6
"12800","Bender: [on TV] Bite my shiny metal ass! [He starts dancing.] Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!
",60,4,6
"12801","Bender: Now that's hospital dancing. [He nudges Calculon.] Pretty good, eh, Calcky?
",60,4,6
"12802","Calculon: Good? I've seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies. [On the screen Bender whistles nonchalantly as he empties a chest of drawers.] I don't even remember shooting this scene.
",60,4,6
"12803","Director: We didn't. That's security camera footage from your dressing room.
",60,4,6
"12804","Calculon: He stole the scene and my money? That's it! I demand you fire this felonious ham!
",60,4,6
"12805","Director: The network Execubots are coming!
",60,4,6
"12806","Calculon: Oh, dear God!
",60,4,6
"12807","Betabot: Presenting the president of the network.
",60,4,6
"12808","Network President: Greetings, gentlemen. You already know my Execubots: Executive Alpha, programmed to like things it has seen before.
",60,4,6
"12809","Alphabot: Hey, hey, hey.
",60,4,6
"12810","Network President: Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice to determine the fall schedule.
",60,4,6
"12811","Betabot: More reality shows.
",60,4,6
"12812","Network President: And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate middle America.
",60,4,6
"12813","Gammabot: It's funny but is it going to get them off their tractors?
",60,4,6
"12814","Network President: Now, who put this obnoxious, dancing robot on my network?
",60,4,6
"12815","Director: We were about to fire him, sir.
",60,4,6
"12816","Network President: Silence, hack! We've been monitoring our Nielsen families carefully. And during the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, viewer eyeball focus was up 90%.
",60,4,6
"12817","Calculon: But, sir, children watch this show. Bender's no role model, he's a filth monger!
",60,4,6
"12818","Network President: At our network, we love filth! Filthy rich, that is! Being filthy rich, that is! [He laughs and signals fizzle towards the Execubots, making them all laugh with him.] ""Bite my shiny metal ass"" could be a catchphrase.
",60,4,6
"12819","Alphabot: 80% likely.
",60,4,6
"12820","Gammabot: It will play in Peoria.
",60,4,6
"12821","Betabot: Gameshows are back.
",60,4,6
"12822","Network President: We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot on our network. Bender? Can you continue to drink, smoke and steal things on TV?
",60,4,6
"12823","Bender: Yes, I can.
",60,4,6
"12824","Tinny Tim: Yeah! Shooting!
",60,4,6
"12825","Dwight: Alright!
",60,4,6
"12826","Dwight: Yo! Check out what I jacked from my dad.
",60,4,6
"12827","Cubert: A cigar!
",60,4,6
"12828","Tinny Tim: Ripping!
",60,4,6
"12829","Dwight: Look! I'm Bender!
",60,4,6
"12830","Hermes: Ras H. Tafari! What's goin' on here?
",60,4,6
"12831","Farnsworth: The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
",60,4,6
"12832","Hermes: That's not a cigar. Uh ... and it's not mine!
",60,4,6
"12833","Cubert: Hey, Dad! Bite my shiny metal ass!
",60,4,6
"12834","Farnsworth: What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
",60,4,6
"12835","Tinny Tim: From Bender, my good jerkwad.
",60,4,6
"12836","Hermes: Bender, eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads.
",60,4,6
"12837","Bender: OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part.
",60,4,6
"12838","Zoidberg: Quiet, robot! Bender's on TV.
",60,4,6
"12839","Monique: [on TV] Oh, Calculon, it's so good to get away from the city and that beastly, yet intriguing, Bender.
",60,4,6
"12840","Bender: [on TV] Try this, kids at home!
",60,4,6
"12841","Linda: [on TV] Is television sensation Bender a bad role model for Earth children?
",60,4,6
"12842","Bender: That's crazy!
",60,4,6
"12843","Linda: [on TV] A new protest group, Fathers Against Rude Television, says ""Hell, yes!""
",60,4,6
"12844","Fry: Pft! What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
",60,4,6
"12845","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group.
",60,4,6
"12846","Zoidberg: That was uncanny.
",60,4,6
"12847","Hermes: Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth.
",60,4,6
"12848","Farnsworth: And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
",60,4,6
"12849","Hermes: No, sir! Not us FARTers.
",60,4,6
"12850","Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model.
",60,4,6
"12851","Leela: As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
",60,4,6
"12852","Fry: Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
",60,4,6
"12853","Cubert: Our dads are all pumped up on dork-osterone. We're just trying to be cool, like Bender.
",60,4,6
"12854","Dwight: Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking and drinking make us barf.
",60,4,6
"12855","Tinny Tim: Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate Bender without barfing. We could commit a burglary.
",60,4,6
"12856","Dwight: Hey, yeah!
",60,4,6
"12857","Cubert: Bender loves to burgle!
",60,4,6
"12858","Dwight: Hold up, though. Who could we rob? We don't even know anyone with cool stuff.
",60,4,6
"12859","Cubert: Duh! We know someone who runs on pure cool fuel: Bender!
",60,4,6
"12860","Dwight: Whoa!
",60,4,6
"12861","Tinny Tim: We'll rob Bender!
",60,4,6
"12862","Dwight: TV gave us the idea.
",60,4,6
"12863","Bender: [voice-over] You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery.
",60,4,6
"12864","Cubert: OK. It's crime time.
",60,4,6
"12865","Fry: Hey, Bender. [Cubert walks past with a Bender portrait.] Hey, Bender. [Dwight struggles with a safe marked ""Bender's Loot"".] Hey, Bender. [The phone rings. Fry picks up.] Hey, Bender.
",60,4,6
"12866","Farnsworth: What's going on in here? [The music stops. Hermes rubs some dirt off Farnsworth's glasses and Farnsworth straightens them.] Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
",60,4,6
"12867","Hermes: Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?
",60,4,6
"12868","Zoidberg: I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
",60,4,6
"12869","Cubert: Relax, Dad. We just invited a few friends over.
",60,4,6
"12870","Farnsworth: Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. [He gasps.] Of course! You don't have friends!
",60,4,6
"12871","Hermes: Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
",60,4,6
"12872","Dwight: Um ... we're just cool, is all!
",60,4,6
"12873","Farnsworth: Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!
",60,4,6
"12874","Cool-o-Meter: Oh, yeah!
",60,4,6
"12875","Farnsworth: Good Lord! I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies.
",60,4,6
"12876","Hermes: Everybody out!
",60,4,6
"12877","Zoidberg: So, do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party.
",60,4,6
"12878","Hermes: There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?
",60,4,6
"12879","Tinny Tim: Don't tell, comrades. All for one and one for all!
",60,4,6
"12880","Dwight: We stole it!
",60,4,6
"12881","Tinny Tim: Oh, crumb!
",60,4,6
"12882","Bender: What? What's going on?
",60,4,6
"12883","Farnsworth: I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
",60,4,6
"12884","Hermes: And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk.
",60,4,6
"12885","Bender: Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole! [He takes Playbot from Tinny Tim.] That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!
",60,4,6
"12886","Bender: Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? [The dads cheer.] Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!

",60,4,6
"12891","Calculon: As a doctor and captain of this hospital ship, I now pronounce you man and wife with six months to live.
",60,4,6
"12892","Farnsworth: Listen up, Hollywood. We're an exciting, new mob.
",60,4,6
"12893","Bender: Yeah!
",60,4,6
"12894","Hermes: You'd better believe it!
",60,4,6
"12895","Calculon: Great Shatner's ghost!
",60,4,6
"12896","Bender: We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
",60,4,6
"12897","Farnsworth: Booya!
",60,4,6
"12898","Network President: I'm afraid the answer is a gritty, in-your-face no.
",60,4,6
"12899","Bender: Then I quit.
",60,4,6
"12900","Network President: Then you don't quit. [His CD-ROM drive opens and one of the Execubots puts a gun in it and connects it to him.] I think you'll be finishing the scene now, Mr. Bender. And don't skimp on the nasty.
",60,4,6
"12901","Farnsworth: There'll be no further nasty. [He takes a laser out of his lab coat.] We still have the option of resorting to violence.
",60,4,6
"12902","Hermes: What makes you think that'll work?
",60,4,6
"12903","Farnsworth: I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that?
",60,4,6
"12904","Bender: Ooh, yeah! C'mon--
",60,4,6
"12905","Farnsworth: Quit the show!
",60,4,6
"12906","Network President: Do the scene.
",60,4,6
"12907","Farnsworth: I'm a cold-blooded punk!
",60,4,6
"12908","Network President: I once put a laugh track on a sitcom that had no jokes in it.
",60,4,6
"12909","Bender: Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!
",60,4,6
"12910","Network President: Really?
",60,4,6
"12911","Farnsworth: Wha?
",60,4,6
"12912","Bender: Aha!
",60,4,6
"12913","Farnsworth: I was using that!
",60,4,6
"12914","Bender: Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.
",60,4,6
"12915","Director: You're angry.
",60,4,6
"12916","Bender: Perfect. [He turns to the camera.] Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do. [He blows some cigar smoke.] How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes"". But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not! [He accidentally fires Farnsworth's laser and a laser bolt flies over Farnsworth's head, narrowly missing him. Bender clears his throat.] Uh ... on the other hand, most, perhaps all the blame, rests with the parents. That's right, you! [He points his firearms at the FART mob and they gasp and duck.] And so I ask you this one question: Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
",60,4,6
"12917","Hermes: [ashamed] We're just so busy.
",60,4,6
"12918","Bender: Well make time.
",60,4,6
"12919","Director: And ... cut!
",60,4,6
"12920","Calculon: Good enough. Splice in some reaction shots of me and shove it on the air.

"12924","Farnsworth: Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while.

[He rolls up a newspaper and pours the milk into it. He then unrolls the newspaper.] Behold, the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!
",61,4,7
"12948","Fry: Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender the Magnificent""!
",61,4,7
"12949","Bender: No, it isn't.
",61,4,7
"12950","Fry: Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at.
",61,4,7
"12951","Bender: Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious.
",61,4,7
"12952","Fry: Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
",61,4,7
"12953","Bender: You lived before you met me?
",61,4,7
"12954","Fry: Sure. Lots of people did.
",61,4,7

",61,4,7
"12956","Bender: Truly, they were as gods who built this place!
",61,4,7
"12957","Tour Guide: Next, we come to the splendidly-preserved wooden pizza paddle. [She presses a button and a robot chef bats a robot delivery boy with the paddle.] Scientists theorise it was used to gently discipline the delivery boy.
",61,4,7
"12958","Fry: Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! [He grabs the paddle.] And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats.
",61,4,7
"12959","Tour Guide: I don't know where you get your facts, sir, but I am a volunteer housewife with 45 minutes of orientation and a Harlequin romance about archaeologists.
",61,4,7

",61,4,7
"12961","Man: [on intercom] Yes?
",61,4,7
"12962","Fry: Pizza delivery for Mr. ... [He checks the note.] ... Seymour Asses.
",61,4,7

",61,4,7
"12965","Fry: Aw! Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here ... [He offers the dog a slice.] ... but if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses. [The dog snaffles the slice.] I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs ... are you? Nah! We understand each other. [He hands Seymour another slice.] People think you're just a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and you call no man ""Mister"". [He gets up and gets on his bike.] Well, goodbye. [He does the Vulcan salute.] Live long and prosper.

"12966","Bender: Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
",61,4,7
"12967","Fry: No! That's my dog in there. It's an outrage, I say! [He grabs Bender by his foot and uses him to smash the display case. He takes Seymour and Bender hops around holding his foot, screaming in pain.] I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me. [Two security guards grab him.] Uh-oh!
",61,4,7
"12968","Bender: And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified.
",61,4,7
"12969","Fry: Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
",61,4,7
"12970","Amy: Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
",61,4,7
"12971","Fry: I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation.

",61,4,7
"12981","Panucci: Hey! There's our little mascot. [Seymour shakes himself.] Aw, you been swimming in the sewer again? [He rubs Seymour down with the pizza dough.] You rascal! [He ladles tomato sauce onto the dough. Some spills onto the floor.] Fry, cleanup!

"12982","Fry: Seymour, cleanup! [Seymour licks up the tomato sauce.] Good dog!
",61,4,7

",61,4,7
"12987","Leela: Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort.
",61,4,7
"12988","Ben Beeler: Mr. Fry? I'm Dr. Ben Beeler, the palaeontologist who discovered your dog. Or as some call it, the ""Beelersaurus"".
",61,4,7
"12989","Fry: So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
",61,4,7
"12990","Beeler: No, we're sorry but there's just too much that fossil can teach us about dogs from your time.
",61,4,7
"12991","Fry: His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus.
",61,4,7
"12992","Ray: The 29? Interesting.
",61,4,7

",61,4,7

",61,4,7

",61,4,7

",61,4,7
"12998","Zoidberg: I was all in this part! It's magic!
",61,4,7

",61,4,7
"13001","Fry: Good news, everyone!
",61,4,7
"13002","Bender: Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!
",61,4,7
"13003","Farnsworth: No. Actually we've discovered that Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!
",61,4,7
"13004","Fry: Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
",61,4,7
"13005","Zoidberg: A little land mammal!
",61,4,7
"13006","Fry: Can you believe it, Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!
",61,4,7
"13007","Cubert: Why the idiot convention?
",61,4,7
"13008","Farnsworth: Ah, Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog using the very same apparatus I used to clone you. [He looks into the cloning tank.] Ooh, look! There's a smidge of toe still in here. [He picks it up and hands it to Cubert. He walks over to a computer and presses a button and Seymour appears.] You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat.
",61,4,7
"13009","Fry: So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
",61,4,7
"13010","Farnsworth: Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death.
",61,4,7
"13011","Fry: I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!
",61,4,7
"13012","Bender: Crappy ineffective Reaper!
",61,4,7
"13013","Farnsworth: I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
",61,4,7
"13014","Computer Voice: The dog says--

"13016","Boy: You stink, loser!
",61,4,7
"13017","Panucci: Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out. C'mon!
",61,4,7
"13018","Fry: But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.
",61,4,7
"13019","Panucci: Like you got squat to celebrate! You're a delivery boy this millennium and you'll be a delivery boy next millennium! [Fry sighs and picks up the pizza. He walks to the door. Seymour grabs his trouser leg and holds Fry back.] What's with Seymour? It's like he don't want you to go. Or he thinks your pants is too short, or somethin'. Which is crazy 'cause, frankly, you look fabulous. Now get goin'!
",61,4,7
"13020","Fry: I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back.
",61,4,7
"13021","Fry: Hello? Pizza delivery for ... [He reads the delivery note.] ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! [He sits down and opens the can.] Here's to another lousy millennium.
",61,4,7
"13022","Crowd: [chanting] Five, four, three, two.
",61,4,7
"13023","Fry: What the--?
",61,4,7
"13024","Bender: A dog collar, for me? [He puts it on.] You shouldn't have!
",61,4,7
"13025","Fry: That's for Seymour.
",61,4,7
"13026","Bender: Oh.
",61,4,7
"13027","Bender: Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? [He puts on some glasses.] That's not a reputable journal of opinion.
",61,4,7
"13028","Fry: Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned.
",61,4,7
"13029","Bender: Are you on the junk, Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?
",61,4,7
"13030","Fry: Hey, he was smart! He could fetch.
",61,4,7
"13031","Bender: I can fetch.
",61,4,7
"13032","Fry: He could dig up bones.
",61,4,7
"13033","Bender: Hello? Charlemagne? [He opens his chest cabinet door, revealing bones and a crown.] Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head.
",61,4,7
"13034","Fry: Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you.
",61,4,7
"13035","Bender: That's impossible!
",61,4,7
"13036","Fry: Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse.
",61,4,7
"13037","Bender: No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it. [Fry hammers the sign on but the hammer head flies off and hits Bender.] Ow!
",61,4,7
"13038","Fry: [on phone] This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each.
",61,4,7
"13039","Mr. Fry: Phil, it's your father. Where are you? You're holding up New Year's brunch. Your brother can't wait any longer.

",61,4,7
"13041","Mrs. Fry: Well that's weird. Seymour's here but-- [She turns to the TV.] Go! Go! Touchdown! But where's Philip?
",61,4,7
"13042","Mr. Fry: I'm tellin' you, the Y2K computer's got him. We'll face burnin' roads, rivers exploding, calculators transformed into Scud missiles. There's nothing we can do. [Seymour climbs onto the TV and barks Walking On Sunshine.] What's that, Seymour? You walking on sunshine?
",61,4,7
"13043","Yancy: He's trying to tell us something. Maybe he can lead us to Philip.
",61,4,7
"13044","Yancy: Should we follow him?
",61,4,7
"13045","Mr. Fry: To our deaths? Negatory.
",61,4,7
"13046","Mr. Fry: It's the Y2K tryin' to lure us into an ambush. And I ain't buyin' it. Pass the baloney.
",61,4,7
"13047","Fry: Are you two gonna be done soon?
",61,4,7
"13048","Leela: Sorry, but we need to practise hand-to-hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands and they slide way across the room.
",61,4,7
"13049","Fry: Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
",61,4,7
"13050","Leela: OK.
",61,4,7
"13051","Bender: Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy.
",61,4,7
"13052","Fry: [indifferent] That's nice.
",61,4,7
"13053","Bender: I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet.
",61,4,7
"13054","Robo-Puppy: Robo-Puppy receiving petting.
",61,4,7
"13055","Amy: Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!
",61,4,7
"13056","Bender: Jealous? [He laughs and picks up Robo-Puppy.] Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
",61,4,7
"13057","Robo-Puppy: Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. [It's tongue comes out.] Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.
",61,4,7
"13058","Bender: Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?
",61,4,7
"13059","Fry: Ah, there! Perfect!
",61,4,7
"13060","Holo-Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! The Clone-O-Mat is ready!
",61,4,7

"13063","Farnsworth: Behold once more, the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself. [Lightning strikes and the staff ""Ooh"".] I speak, of course, of molten lava deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!
",61,4,7
"13064","Farnsworth: Powering up Clone-O-Mat. [He plugs in the cord and the Clone-O-Mat bubbles.] Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form. [He puts Seymour down.] Initiating dog brain CAT scan.
",61,4,7
"13065","Fry: Come on, boy! Come back to life!
",61,4,7
"13066","Farnsworth: Know ye now what feels like to be dog god! Commencing DNA extraction.
",61,4,7
"13067","Bender: Fry, c'mon, the talent show!
",61,4,7
"13068","Fry: What? I'm in the middle of something.
",61,4,7
"13069","Bender: But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?
",61,4,7
"13070","Fry: Bender, enough! Leave me alone!
",61,4,7
"13071","Bender: So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!
",61,4,7
"13072","Leela: No!
",61,4,7
"13073","Zoidberg: Oh!
",61,4,7
"13074","Bender: Now I'm all you got!
",61,4,7
"13075","Fry: I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man! [He kicks him.] Ow!
",61,4,7
"13076","Bender: So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
",61,4,7
"13077","Farnsworth: Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
",61,4,7
"13078","Fry: May yet? Really?
",61,4,7
"13079","Farnsworth: Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite; The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan. [He takes an ice swan out of the freezer and takes it towards the lava. It immediately melts.] Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived.
",61,4,7
"13080","Fry: So Seymour might still exist?
",61,4,7
"13081","Farnsworth: Perhaps, for a few minutes. It's dolomite, baby!
",61,4,7
"13082","Fry: Then I'm goin' in after him.
",61,4,7
"13083","Amy: [shouting] No!
",61,4,7

",61,4,7
"13085","Fry: He'd come after me!
",61,4,7
"13086","Leela: Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
",61,4,7
"13087","Fry: Then all hope is lost. [He lifts himself up and looks at the lava.] Goodbye, Seymour.
",61,4,7
"13088","Bender: Please stop crying, Fry. Here. [He hands him a coloured handkerchief which is tied to several more in his sleeve.] I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?
",61,4,7
"13089","Zoidberg: You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
",61,4,7
"13090","Bender: Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty. [He looks into the lava.] I'm goin' in!
",61,4,7
"13091","Farnsworth: I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite.
",61,4,7
"13092","Bender: I'm 40% dolomite! [He bangs his chest and dives in. His hat and cape float on the surface and everyone gasps. Bender swims through the lava and his casing starts to come apart.] Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!
",61,4,7
"13093","Cryogenisist: Ugh! I am one hungover cryogenisist. Just throw that mutt in the freezer till his owners get here.

",61,4,7
"13098","Mrs. Fry: Sorry we're late. We all got sick from eating bad baloney.

"13099","Mr. Fry: Y2K!
",61,4,7
"13100","Mrs. Fry: What's he so worked up about?
",61,4,7
"13101","Mr. Fry: He's just upset 'cause our boy's missing. [He clips a lead onto Seymour.] C'mon, you overgrown rat. Lead us to Philip.
",61,4,7
"13102","Leela: Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
",61,4,7
"13103","Farnsworth: Professor! Lava! Hot!
",61,4,7
"13104","Fry: This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back. [He cries. The ground starts to shake and Bender erupts through it with Seymour.] Bender!
",61,4,7
"13105","Bender: And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent! [His eyes melt and fall out.] Hey, where'd everybody go?
",61,4,7
"13106","Bender: OK! Let's clone us some dog!
",61,4,7
"13107","Fry: Yeah!
",61,4,7
"13108","Farnsworth: Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin! [He pulls the chain again and Seymour is zapped and his DNA is extracted. ""Species: Canais Familiaris. Age: 15"" is displayed on a screen.] Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.
",61,4,7
"13109","Fry: 15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
",61,4,7
"13110","Farnsworth: Indeed.
",61,4,7
"13111","Fry: Stop the cloning.
",61,4,7
"13112","Farnsworth: Oh, sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!
",61,4,7
"13113","Bender: Fry, what's wrong?
",61,4,7
"13114","Fry: Think about it: Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
",61,4,7
"13115","Bender: But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
",61,4,7
"13116","Fry: I had Seymour till he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him. [He picks up Seymour's fossil.] I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago.

",62,4,8
"13135","Narrator: [in movie] Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time. [There are shots of bigger ice cubes being dropped into the ocean.] Thus solving the problem once and for all.

",62,4,8
"13166","Leela: Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?
",62,4,8

"13168","Hermes: What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
",62,4,8
"13169","Bender: For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell. [He bangs his casing then the turtle's shell.] But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know.

",62,4,8
"13188","Fry: Good for him!
",62,4,8
"13189","Gore: My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book Earth in the Balance and the much more popular Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth, we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards.
",62,4,8
"13190","Dark Wizard: Sure! Blame the wizards!
",62,4,8
"13191","Gore: That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon Sapphires to the first scientist who can solve this problem once and for all. [The audience ""Ooh's"".] Lovely, aren't they?

",62,4,8

",62,4,8
"13195","Wernstrom: Ladies and gentlemen, I have placed in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 40% of the sun's rays, thus cooling Earth. Observe.
",62,4,8

"13197","Man: Ooh! That's a little bright.
",62,4,8
"13198","Gore: Alright, what else we got?
",62,4,8
"13199","Fry: Professor, you're a professor. You must have some ideas.
",62,4,8
"13200","Farnsworth: Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
",62,4,8
"13201","Gore: Our next speaker is Professor--
",62,4,8
"13202","Farnsworth: I demand the floor!
",62,4,8
"13203","Gore: Yes, it's your turn to speak.
",62,4,8
"13204","Farnsworth: Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! [He walks on stage.] I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Oh, it haunts my memory still.
",62,4,8
"13205","Fry: Professor, no! Don't do it!
",62,4,8
"13206","Farnsworth: Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
",62,4,8
"13207","Farnsworth: [voice-over] It was October 17th at 1:54pm and 14 birds were flying by the window. I was working at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Back then, you see, robots were slow-moving, stiff and a little on the uptight side.
",62,4,8
"13208","Prototype: Oh, dear. Might I favour master with a tender kiss on the forehead?
",62,4,8
"13209","Farnsworth: Oh, I've failed again.
",62,4,8
"13210","Prototype: Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
",62,4,8
"13211","Farnsworth: [voice-over] The owner of the company pressured me to create a bigger sportier robot.
",62,4,8
"13212","Farnsworth: Stop!
",62,4,8
"13213","Farnsworth: [voice-over] It wasn't easy but, by sacrificing fuel efficiency, I succeeded.
",62,4,8
"13214","Mom: What was that?
",62,4,8
"13215","Farnsworth: A flaming burp.
",62,4,8
"13216","Mom: Does it always do that?
",62,4,8
"13217","Farnsworth: It's not always a burp. We still have one problem though: This robot will never meet emission standards.
",62,4,8
"13218","Mom: Crap spackle! [She slaps him.] We'll just call it a sport utility robot and classify it as a light truck.
",62,4,8
"13219","Farnsworth: Well, I suppose the environment can take one more for the team.
",62,4,8
"13220","Farnsworth: [voice-over] What a fool I was. If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot. But I was tired and in love.
",62,4,8
"13221","Mom: Take me now, you stud!
",62,4,8
"13222","Farnsworth: Oh, this is all my fault!
",62,4,8
"13223","Fry: That's awful, Professor. Especially the making-out part.
",62,4,8
"13224","Gore: Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.
",62,4,8
"13225","Farnsworth: All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.
",62,4,8
"13226","Wernstrom: Huh, so the robots are to blame. As I suspected. [He speaks into the microphone.] We are left with only one possible course of action, grim though it be.
",62,4,8
"13227","Bender: I got a good feeling about this!
",62,4,8
"13228","Wernstrom: We must immediately and permanently shut down, dismantle and destroy all robots!
",62,4,8
"13229","Bender: No!
",62,4,8
"13230","Farnsworth: Wait, surely there's a better--
",62,4,8
"13231","Van: The conference is over.
",62,4,8
"13232","Gore: I must go now, to help collect cans on Jupiter. Peace out, y'all!
",62,4,8

",62,4,8
"13235","Fry: Be brave, my friend.
",62,4,8
"13236","Leela: Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime. [She holds up a bottle of beer.] Would you do it for a Bender snack?
",62,4,8

",62,4,8
"13238","Leela: Gotcha!
",62,4,8
"13239","Bender: Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer! [They struggle with the bottle. Bender pulls it away and runs off with it.] Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now? [He cackles and his head comes out. He drinks the beer and flag appears on his antenna.] I've got mail!
",62,4,8
"13240","Amy: Ooh! It's a party, apparently.
",62,4,8
"13241","Nixon: [on card] Do you like to party? To boogie down? Well I'm throwing an all-night beach raver for my robot pals. It all goes down Saturday on the isolated Galapagos Islands where there will be no escape ... from the fun! All robots must attend.
",62,4,8
"13242","Zoidberg: Strange: Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable? [He snaps his claws.] It's a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots! [No one reacts.] I don't hear any gasping.
",62,4,8
"13243","Leela: We all figured that out.
",62,4,8
"13244","Bender: Well, I'm off.
",62,4,8
"13245","Fry: Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.

",62,4,8
"13247","Fry: I won't let you!
",62,4,8
"13248","Bender: Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for: This mindless turtle.

"13249","Fry: Bender, this world isn't good enough for you.
",62,4,8

",62,4,8
"13255","Bender: Ew!
",62,4,8
"13256","Nixon: Attention, happening robots: Who's got what it takes to party with Nixon? [The robots cheer.] You fellas enjoy yourselves for the next two hours. And be sure not to leave the island, uh, for at least two hours. I'm going out to pick up some smokes ... uh, really good smokes. Two hours. [The robots cheer.] OK, headless body of Agnew, let's blow this joint!
",62,4,8
"13257","Crushinator: [mechanical voice] Do you want to dance?
",62,4,8
"13258","Bender: Nah, I'm not really in the--
",62,4,8
"13259","Crushinator: [mechanical voice] You know you want to.
",62,4,8
"13260","Wernstrom: Per your orders, I modified my mirror to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse at the Galapagos. Every robot will be instantly and painfully terminated. Now for your part of the bargain.
",62,4,8
"13261","Nixon: Aroo! Very well. Agnew, you belong to Wernstrom now.
",62,4,8
"13262","Bender: I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. [whispering] Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--

",62,4,8
"13278","Bender: [shouting] You're one to talk!
",62,4,8
"13279","Farnsworth: But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst, it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it. [The robots ""Ooh"".] By my calculations, we'll need the full force of every last robot. So, quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards. [The robots turn their exhausts up.] Now vent! Vent like the wind! [The robots vent. A huge flame rises into the sky but nothing happens.] Harder! Harder!

",63,4,9
"13321","Amy: Right on.
",63,4,9
"13322","Fry: Yup.
",63,4,9
"13323","Bender: Uh-huh!
",63,4,9
"13324","Hermes: We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you euthasised.
",63,4,9
"13325","Farnsworth: Dear God, no!
",63,4,9
"13326","Amy: Oh, relax, Professor. ""Youthasizing"" is a trendy, new spa treatment. It's this season's shark-cartilage enema.
",63,4,9
"13327","Farnsworth: But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy"" TV sitcoms.
",63,4,9
"13328","Leela: OK, OK. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him!
",63,4,9
"13329","Farnsworth: [shouting] My thong!
",63,4,9
"13330","Heather: Hi! I'm Heather, your personal Youthasizer. Let's get started with a nice botulism treatment, shall we?
",63,4,9
"13331","Farnsworth: Go to hell, Heather!
",63,4,9
"13332","Heather: Oh! [She smiles and draws a syringe of warm canned mushrooms.] In small doses, botchelism toxin tightens and tones the facial muscles instead of killing you in the most horrible fashion imaginable.
",63,4,9
"13333","Farnsworth: Give me back my floppy face!
",63,4,9
"13334","Farnsworth: Careful with the giblets!
",63,4,9
"13335","Heather: Hmm. You're still retaining a lot of grump in these joints. [She turns to the masseuse.] More pressure.
",63,4,9
"13336","Heather: Since this is such a serious case of old, we'll have to try our strongest treatment: A soothing full-body bath in searing-hot tar. [She indicates the pits.] Sir, it's not necessary or wise to be naked.
",63,4,9
"13337","Farnsworth: You sound just like my tennis instructor.
",63,4,9
"13338","Heather: The tar blisters the age right out of the body in what top scientists suspect is a miracle.
",63,4,9
"13339","Farnsworth: Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
",63,4,9
"13340","Fry: He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
",63,4,9
"13341","Bender: Step aside, lady. [He starts pumping.] Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending. [He pumps harder and the tar starts bobbing around. It throws Farnsworth up and down. The staff watch.] [mean voice] C'mon, Bender, pump harder! Harder! [weak voice] I'm trying as hard as I can. [mean voice] Harder, damn you!
",63,4,9
"13342","Farnsworth: Well, that was an utter waste of time.
",63,4,9
"13343","Amy: Professor, it worked! You look young enough to be my father!
",63,4,9
"13344","Farnsworth: Poodle spit! [Heather scans him and the scanner displays ""53"". He gasps.] 53 years old? [He sighs.] Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
",63,4,9
"13345","Fry: [voice breaking] This is great, Professor! We should go out and celebrate!
",63,4,9
"13346","Farnsworth: Dear Lord! You've all reverted to your childhood forms.
",63,4,9
"13347","Zoidberg: Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again!
",63,4,9
"13348","Farnsworth: While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals.
",63,4,9
"13349","Hermes: It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy! [He fires one at Zoidberg.] Stop it, Amy!
",63,4,9
"13350","Amy: You stink!
",63,4,9
"13351","Hermes: You know you did it!
",63,4,9
"13352","Farnsworth: Quiet! Quiet, I say!
",63,4,9
"13353","LaBarbara: We're here to take my little stub of a husband home. Hermes, say goodbye to Mr. Farnsworth.
",63,4,9
"13354","Hermes: Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!
",63,4,9
"13355","Leela: Hey! This my chance to spend time with my parents too.
",63,4,9
"13356","Fry: But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
",63,4,9
"13357","Leela: When I was an orphan, I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time--
",63,4,9
"13358","Farnsworth: That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
",63,4,9
"13359","Leela: It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad.
",63,4,9
"13360","Morris: Can't I just beat up the kid?
",63,4,9
"13361","Munda: Well, OK, Leela. If you think you can put up with your father, then welcome home. We'll try to respect your independence and freedom.
",63,4,9
"13362","Leela: No! I want the real teen experience: Chores, curfew, the works!
",63,4,9
"13363","Morris: Fine, Sweetiekins, we'll be the strictest parents ever. Now, let's all have some tequila to celebrate!
",63,4,9
"13364","Leela: Dad! I'm underage!
",63,4,9
"13365","Morris: Oh, right. Here's a silly straw.
",63,4,9
"13366","Mrs. Wong: Oh, my Amy's sweet little girl again! This is like a mother's dream. Bad dream, that is! At this rate, I'm never going to get a grandchild!
",63,4,9
"13367","Mr. Wong: Maybe she not grown up but she sure grown out! She fat!
",63,4,9
"13368","Amy: Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again, I'm just gonna stay in my room.
",63,4,9
"13369","Mr. Wong: Stay in room? You so fat, you gonna stay all around room!
",63,4,9
"13370","Farnsworth: I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
",63,4,9
"13371","Bender: I'm tired of your yapping. [He rides into the room on a motorbike and knocks over a table.] All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!
",63,4,9
"13372","Farnsworth: Fine! Get going!
",63,4,9
"13373","Bender: Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender"".
",63,4,9
"13374","Farnsworth: We won't know that until you leave.
",63,4,9
"13375","Bender: Oh, I'm leaving!
",63,4,9
"13376","Farnsworth: There's the door.
",63,4,9
"13377","Bender: I'll be good.
",63,4,9
"13378","Munda: Ah, do you have to shed your skin on the couch? What do we live in, a zoo?
",63,4,9
"13379","Morris: I'm getting the doorbell. [He gets up and opens the door. Fry stands in the doorway with flowers.] For me?
",63,4,9
"13380","Fry: [voice breaking] Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter.
",63,4,9
"13381","Leela: Hi, Fry! I like your blazer.
",63,4,9
"13382","Fry: Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock.
",63,4,9
"13383","Munda: So, where are you taking my daughter tonight?
",63,4,9
"13384","Fry: [voice breaking] A movie. [deep voice] A movie, ma'am.
",63,4,9
"13385","Morris: Well, whatever you're really doing, don't wake us if you get in after 12.
",63,4,9
"13386","Leela: Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11.
",63,4,9
"13387","Munda: OK, OK. You're the boss!
",63,4,9
"13388","Leela: No, I'm not!
",63,4,9
"13389","Fry: I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces.
",63,4,9
"13390","Leela: What are you, on a diet?
",63,4,9
"13391","Moose: Uh, Leela, you look hot.
",63,4,9
"13392","Mandy: Jeez, Moose! Just dump me right in front of her, why don't you.
",63,4,9
"13393","Leela: Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface.
",63,4,9
"13394","Mandy: Oh, so this is the famous Fry. What is he, like, the biggest loser on the surface so he has to hang out in the sewer?
",63,4,9
"13395","Fry: [whispering] They're onto me!
",63,4,9
"13396","Leela: Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?
",63,4,9
"13397","Moose: Uh, yeah!
",63,4,9
"13398","Sal: Theres. The world's drinkings water is safes for another days. [Moose's car comes flying through.] Whoas! [Followed by Leela's car.] Cripe!
",63,4,9
"13399","Leela: A tapeworm!
",63,4,9
"13400","Fry: We missed the turn. We'll never catch them.
",63,4,9
"13401","Leela: Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!
",63,4,9
"13402","Farnsworth: [from bathroom] The devil take this predictable colon!
",63,4,9
"13403","Fry: Yeah!
",63,4,9
"13404","Leela: Alright!
",63,4,9
"13405","Fry: Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!
",63,4,9
"13406","Leela: I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
",63,4,9
"13407","Dwayne: That's detention!
",63,4,9
"13408","Fry: And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!
",63,4,9
"13409","Farnsworth: Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose. But, in the meantime, I have good news. I may have solved our age problem.
",63,4,9
"13410","Fry: Yay!
",63,4,9
"13411","Farnsworth: It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or ""RNA"".
",63,4,9
"13412","Bender: Question.
",63,4,9
"13413","Farnsworth: Yes?
",63,4,9
"13414","Bender: You stink!
",63,4,9
"13415","Farnsworth: Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium that should take the tar right off.
",63,4,9
"13416","Fry: [voice breaking] C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
",63,4,9
"13417","Leela: Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment.
",63,4,9
"13418","Farnsworth: Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended.
",63,4,9
"13419","Munda: He has a point, honey. What about your job and your friends? Do you really want to abandon your old life?
",63,4,9
"13420","Leela: My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?
",63,4,9
"13421","Munda: Well if it's what you really want.
",63,4,9
"13422","Leela: It is. I know it is.
",63,4,9
"13423","Fry: I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up.
",63,4,9
"13424","Leela: [whispering] Bring beer.
",63,4,9
"13425","Morris: No beer till you finish your tequila!
",63,4,9
"13426","Farnsworth: [shouting] The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber.
",63,4,9
"13427","Amy: Let's go!
",63,4,9
"13428","Bender: [sarcastic] Yes, everyone do the same thing!
",63,4,9
"13429","Farnsworth: Initiating controlled infection.
",63,4,9
"13430","Zoidberg: I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge.
",63,4,9
"13431","Amy: Aw, pooh! We're even younger!
",63,4,9
"13432","Farnsworth: Day-umn! The bacteria pigged-out on the tar and now they're getting freaky-deaky, spreading Chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!
",63,4,9
"13433","Amy: Yikes!
",63,4,9
"13434","Zoidberg: What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?
",63,4,9
"13435","Farnsworth: Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death: Pre-life ... then death.
",63,4,9
"13436","Farnsworth: I've got to stop this reverse-aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of un-birth. Think, you disco duck, think!
",63,4,9
"13437","Amy: What's that squirmal under your shirt?
",63,4,9
"13438","Farnsworth: Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!
",63,4,9
"13439","Zoidberg: Oh, sure, like you need all your blood.
",63,4,9
"13440","Farnsworth: Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh, I need a babysitter.
",63,4,9
"13441","Leela: OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story.
",63,4,9
"13442","Zoidberg: I can't see from down here, I can't.
",63,4,9
"13443","Leela: There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
",63,4,9
"13444","Fry: I wanna hear a space story!
",63,4,9
"13445","Leela: It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging.
",63,4,9
"13446","Farnsworth: The Fountain of Aging? Hmm. It is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now he's head of the FBI.
",63,4,9
"13447","Farnsworth: Sup? Kids ready?
",63,4,9
"13448","Fry: Professy's back! [He lets go.] Ew! You smell like smoking! [He sniffs.] And drinking.
",63,4,9
"13449","Farnsworth: I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
",63,4,9
"13450","Leela: I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over.
",63,4,9
"13451","Munda: Who cares, Leela? It was just a public school. Now go with your friends, please.
",63,4,9
"13452","Leela: No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
",63,4,9
"13453","Leela: Until she sneaks out!
",63,4,9
"13454","Bender: When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!
",63,4,9
"13455","Leela: According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction.
",63,4,9
"13456","Farnsworth: Teddy Bear Junction: The worst scum-hole in the galaxy.
",63,4,9
"13457","Farnsworth: This solar system is, like, way old.
",63,4,9
"13458","Leela: Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
",63,4,9
"13459","Farnsworth: Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that ancient, burnt-out sun.
",63,4,9
"13460","Leela: Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself.
",63,4,9
"13461","Farnsworth: Shut up! I was gonna say that!
",63,4,9
"13462","Leela: We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
",63,4,9
"13463","Farnsworth: We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again. [Zoidberg falls in and rapidly ages.] [shouting] Zoidberg! Get out of there!
",63,4,9
"13464","Zoidberg: [shouting] The current! It's too much, already! Help!
",63,4,9
"13465","Farnsworth: Jeepers!
",63,4,9
"13466","Leela: Zoidberg is dead!
",63,4,9
"13467","Zoidberg: No! Zoidberg's brother is dead! [Zoidberg has many heads and sits on the steps.] Funny story: I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
",63,4,9
"13468","Sibling #1: He always had to be the centre of attention!
",63,4,9
"13469","Sibling #2: Let him go!
",63,4,9
"13470","Leela: Oh, no! [The kids revert to foetuses in goo. Bender reverts to a CD of Bending Unit Blueprints.] Quick! Get them into the fountain!
",63,4,9
"13471","Farnsworth: Thanks for the help, Weewa. Once we're gwown up, you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again.
",63,4,9
"13472","Leela: Well, you could bother me a little.
",63,4,9
"13473","Farnsworth: It's working! Hooray! [He starts to lose his grip.] I can't hold on!
",63,4,9
"13474","Leela: I'm coming in after you!
",63,4,9
"13475","Farnsworth: [shouting] No, Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!
",63,4,9
"13476","Fry: We did it! We're the right ages again!
",63,4,9
"13477","Leela: I think I might be a couple years younger.
",63,4,9
"13478","Amy: Oh, me too!
",63,4,9
"13479","Farnsworth: [shouting] Help! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods!
",63,4,9
"13480","Leela: He's too far out! We can't reach him!
",63,4,9
"13481","Farnsworth: [shouting] With my last breath I curse Zoidberg! [He disappears into the vortex. Pazuzu comes out from under the ships wing and flies in and saves him.] Pazuzu! Oh, you came back to me!
",63,4,9
"13482","Hermes: Are you back to your original age, Professor?
",63,4,9
"13483","Farnsworth: Even older! Huzzah!
",63,4,9
"13484","Fry: I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela.
",63,4,9
"13485","Leela: Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am.
",63,4,9
"13486","Fry: The fabulous person!
",63,4,9
"13487","Leela: With friends like you guys--
",63,4,9
"13488","Fry: Fabulous friends!
",63,4,9
"13489","Leela: And I'm really happy I have that life back.
",63,4,9

",64,4,10
"13494","Fry: What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery, people. Let's move! Let's move! [Amy and Zoidberg hop to it. Zoidberg woops.] Amy? Mission profile? [She hands him a card and he moves it backwards and forwards. The card is a hologram of a stick person handing a parcel to a dragon.] Interesting, interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?
",64,4,10
"13495","Zoidberg: Packed and ready, sir.
",64,4,10
"13496","Fry: What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time! [He throws it back at Zoidberg.] I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!

",64,4,10
"13498","Fry: Wh-What? You went without me?
",64,4,10
"13499","Bender: [shouting] You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
",64,4,10

"13501","Leela: Don't worry. Everything went fine.
",64,4,10

"13518","Leela: I do go! He's a very important man.

",64,4,10
"13520","Fry: I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13531","Chaz: I can't fail the mayor. Not ever.
",64,4,10

"13533","Leela: Hey, I hear Fry. [She walks over to him.] Boy, am I glad you're here.
",64,4,10
"13534","Fry: You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
",64,4,10
"13535","Leela: Actually ... they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?
",64,4,10
"13536","Fry: Um ... uh...
",64,4,10
"13537","Leela: And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. [shouting] Have a great night!
",64,4,10
"13538","Fry: Oh, no! Please! No! [The ground shakes as Nibbler drops one.] Perfect!
",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13540","URL: Failure to scoop. Aw, yeah!
",64,4,10
"13541","Fry: Wait! I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns.
",64,4,10
"13542","Chaz: [shouting] Don't worry, Fry. I'll pull some strings -- see if I can't get you tried as a juvenile.
",64,4,10
"13543","Leela: Oh, Chaz!
",64,4,10
"13544","Fry: I'm as worthless as this trash can.
",64,4,10
"13545","Trash Can: You think I'm as worthless as you? Try catching garbage in your head and raising six kids, you dumb townie!
",64,4,10
"13546","Fry: Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop.
",64,4,10
"13547","Nibbler: The poop eradication is but one aspect of your importance.
",64,4,10
"13548","Fry: D-D-Did you just talk?
",64,4,10
"13549","Nibbler: Indeed. And I have other amazing powers as well.
",64,4,10
"13550","Fry: Like what?
",64,4,10
"13551","Fry: Are you my mommy?
",64,4,10
"13552","Nibbler: Negative.
",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13554","Nibbler: Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me ... the Mighty One.
",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13556","Ken: At last, our centuries upon centuries of waiting have achieved fruition.
",64,4,10
"13557","Fry: Aw! Aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?
",64,4,10
"13558","Ken: Stop that! Uh, please. Your Mightiness--
",64,4,10
"13559","Fry: Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.
",64,4,10
"13560","Ken: Does he not know?
",64,4,10
"13561","Nibbler: He does not know.
",64,4,10
"13562","Fiona: He knows not?
",64,4,10
"13563","Nibbler: Knows not does he.
",64,4,10
"13564","Nibblonian: Not he know--
",64,4,10
"13565","Ken: Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform you that the fate of humanity, the fate of our race, indeed the fate of all that exists and ever will exist rests with you. You are the single most important person in the universe.
",64,4,10
"13566","Fry: Oh, snap!
",64,4,10
"13567","Nibbler: On this auspicious occasion, let the horn of eternity cut a thunderous blast.
",64,4,10
"13568","Fiona: The Feast of a Thousand Beasts is begun.
",64,4,10
"13569","Nibblonian: You gonna eat that?
",64,4,10
"13570","Fry: Maybe later.
",64,4,10
"13571","Ken: The time has come to discuss matters of the gravest importance.
",64,4,10
"13572","Nibbler: Fry, do you remember some months ago when the Earth was attacked by flying brains?
",64,4,10
"13573","Fry: Hmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs. Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy.
",64,4,10
"13574","Ken: On the contrary. You remember because you were the only one immune to the Brains' mental attack.
",64,4,10
"13575","Fry: Because I'm so smart?
",64,4,10
"13576","Ken: Oh, my. Anyway, your immunity is due to the fact that you lack the delta brainwave. [He presses a button and an image of Fry trying to eat a pineapple on a rope comes up on the screen.] It's a genetic abnormality which resulted when you went back in time and performed certain actions which made you your own grandfather.
",64,4,10
"13577","Fry: I did do the nasty in the past-y!
",64,4,10
"13578","Nibbler: Verily. And that past nastification is what shields you from the brains. You are the last hope of the universe.
",64,4,10
"13579","Fry: So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
",64,4,10
"13580","Ken: Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
",64,4,10
"13581","Nibbler: For a thousand years, the evil Brains have been constructing the Infosphere, a giant memory bank twice the size of three ordinary memory banks.
",64,4,10
"13582","Fry: What's so evil about that?
",64,4,10
"13583","Fiona: They plan to collect all the information in the universe and store it in the sphere.
",64,4,10
"13584","Fry: So they're trying to learn things?
",64,4,10
"13585","Fiona: Right.
",64,4,10
"13586","Fry: Those bastards!
",64,4,10
"13587","Nibbler: Being Brains, they feel compelled to know everything. And soon they will.
",64,4,10
"13588","Fry: I'm as mad as I've ever been.
",64,4,10
"13589","Ken: Once their task is complete, they will ensure that no new information arises in the only way possible: By destroying the universe.
",64,4,10
"13590","Fry: Now it's personal.
",64,4,10
"13591","Fiona: Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere and plant this quantum-interface bomb, blasting them into an alternate universe from which there is no return.
",64,4,10
"13592","Nibbler: Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff Jr.
",64,4,10
"13593","Fry: OK, let's go through this once more--
",64,4,10
"13594","Fry: Brains!
",64,4,10
"13595","Ken: [on screen] Fear not, Mighty One. Your missing brainwave makes you invisible to them, so long as you avoid intense thinking.
",64,4,10
"13596","Fry: Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.
",64,4,10
"13597","Ken: [on screen] That is most wise.
",64,4,10
"13598","Fry: Who?
",64,4,10
"13599","Ken: [on screen] In a few seconds, the Brain will finish scanning the last bits of information in the universe.
",64,4,10
"13600","Infosphere: [scanning data] Beavers mate for life; 11 greater than 4; for quality carpets, visit Kaplan's carpet warehouse.
",64,4,10
"13601","Ken: [on screen] Now the Infosphere will open its protective crust so as to scan itself, completing its thousand year task.
",64,4,10
"13602","Fiona: [on screen] This is your one chance to enter the sphere. Scoot! Scoot now!
",64,4,10
"13603","Fry: I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
",64,4,10
"13604","Nibbler: [on screen] Roger.
",64,4,10
"13605","Ken: [on screen] Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.
",64,4,10
"13606","Fry: Hey, wait. This brain knows everything about everything, right?
",64,4,10
"13607","Ken: [on screen] It will soon. That's why you're supposed to be setting off a bomb.
",64,4,10
"13608","Fry: Yeah, yeah. But I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time. [He speaks into the console.] Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of--
",64,4,10
"13609","Huge Brain: Correct. Toad mucus.
",64,4,10
"13610","Ken: [on screen] There's no time for this. Activate the bomb.
",64,4,10
"13611","Fry: Wait, wait, wait. [He speaks into the console.] What really killed the dinosaurs?
",64,4,10
"13612","Huge Brain: Me!
",64,4,10
"13613","Computer Voice: Unauthorized data access.
",64,4,10
"13614","Fry: Uh-oh!
",64,4,10
"13615","Big Brain: Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon viewer.
",64,4,10
"13616","Fry: Ew! Gross. Cut it out!
",64,4,10
"13617","Brain #1: Odd. He is immune to our psionic attack.
",64,4,10
"13618","Brain #2: Impossible! We're an ambitious young squad with everything to prove.
",64,4,10
"13619","Big Brain: It appears we are in the presence of the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff Jr., he cannot escape. [It chuckles. Fry picks up the bomb.] Huh?
",64,4,10
"13620","Brain #2: A quantum-interface bomb? Are you insane in the membrane?
",64,4,10
"13621","Fry: You got it, poindexter!
",64,4,10
"13622","Brain #1: Oh, not good!
",64,4,10
"13623","Computer Voice: Detonation in T-60 Earth seconds.
",64,4,10
"13624","Brain #3: You fool! You'll be transported to the other universe with us. Trapped there for all eternity.
",64,4,10
"13625","Brain #1: And we'll form a tightly-knit clique that you won't be part of!
",64,4,10
"13626","Fry: Well at least I did one important thing with my life: Leading good to victory over evil!
",64,4,10
"13627","Nibbler: [on screen] Yay!
",64,4,10
"13628","Ken: [on screen] Exactly!
",64,4,10
"13629","Big Brain: The Nibblonians? Good? Ha! During your last moments in this universe perhaps you should query our database concerning the night of December 31st, 1999.
",64,4,10
"13630","Fry: The day I got frozen? What about it?
",64,4,10
"13631","Nibbler: [on screen] No! Don't ask about that! It-It would be, uh ... boring!
",64,4,10
"13632","Fry: Ah, forget it then.
",64,4,10
"13633","Big Brain: Query!
",64,4,10
"13634","Fry: OK! Sheesh! What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st, 1999?
",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13639","Fry: [on screen] What the--
",64,4,10
"13640","Fry: I-- I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?
",64,4,10
"13641","Computer Voice: Detonation in T-15 seconds.
",64,4,10
"13642","Fry: You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
",64,4,10
"13643","Nibbler: [on screen] We can explain!
",64,4,10
"13644","Fry: No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap!
",64,4,10
"13645","Nibbler: [on screen] We had no choice. You were the only one who could help us. What is one life weighed against the entire universe?
",64,4,10
"13646","Fry: [crying] But it was my life.
",64,4,10
"13647","Computer Voice: Detonation in two, one. Will the owner of a white Pontiac Firebird-- Oh, never mind. Zero!
",64,4,10
"13648","Big Brain: Well, here we are. Trapped for eternity.
",64,4,10
"13649","Brain #2: We could sing American Pie.
",64,4,10
"13650","Fry: Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
",64,4,10
"13651","Huge Brain: I have shocking data relevant to this conversation.
",64,4,10
"13652","Big Brain: We don't care, you dope! We're in another universe. You're not in charge anymore.

"13653","Huge Brain: It is possible for the Philip Fry to resume his life on December 31st, 1999.
",64,4,10
"13654","Fry: Really? I can go back in time?
",64,4,10
"13655","Huge Brain: There is a nexus point between universes at the space-time where you entered the cryogenic tube. You and only you can return there.
",64,4,10
"13656","Big Brain: Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian from pushing you into the cryogenic tube.
",64,4,10
"13657","Fry: That is interesting. Why?
",64,4,10
"13658","Big Brain: It would be as if you never came to the future. You will have your life back and we will succeed in our plan to understand and destroy the universe.
",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13660","Brain #2: The human will be returned to the past!
",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13662","Leela: I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
",64,4,10
"13663","Chaz: Six hours? Pft! Sounds like a real nobody! But now it's time for somebody and some chick he's with to go skating.
",64,4,10
"13664","Leela: You reserved the whole rink?
",64,4,10
"13665","Chaz: Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know whose aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's whose.
",64,4,10
"13666","Leela: Oh, Chaz!
",64,4,10
"13667","Sally: Mr. Vogel, I thought we was going skating.
",64,4,10
"13668","Vogel: No, we're not important enough. Everybody just hold hands until the bus driver comes back from his haircut.

"13669","Leela: Aw, let's let those kids skate with us.

"13670","Chaz: What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress you with my clout here.
",64,4,10
"13671","Leela: I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids.
",64,4,10
"13672","Nina: We came here instead of eating today.

",64,4,10

"13687","Nibbler: I don't understand.
",64,4,10
"13688","Fry: Yes, you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer and now I came back in time to stop you.
",64,4,10
"13689","Nibbler: I did not come back in time. My people lack that ability.
",64,4,10
"13690","Fry: But ... I know you in the future. I-I cleaned your poop.
",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13692","Fry: Not if you don't freeze me.
",64,4,10
"13693","Nibbler: Please. Our saviours foresee that in a thousand years, for one moment, the fate of the universe will depend on you. Since you will not live that long I must freeze you now.

",64,4,10

",64,4,10
"13697","Nibbler: Then why are you choking me right now?
",64,4,10
"13698","Fry: Because I don't like being used.
",64,4,10

",64,4,10

"13747","Nichols: As country after country fell under its influence, world leaders became threatened by the movements power. [In Berlin a sign is unveiled saying ""Welcome To Nazi Planet Episode Land. Formerly Germany"".] And so the Trekkies were executed in the manner most befitting virgins.

",65,4,11
"13749","Nichols: Finally, the sacred texts were banned.
",65,4,11
"13750","Takei: The last copies of the 79 episodes and six movies were dumped on the forbidden world, Omega 3, along with that blooper reel where the door doesn't close all the way.
",65,4,11
"13751","Nimoy: Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured from human memory.
",65,4,11
"13752","Bender: Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
",65,4,11
"13753","Zapp: I've never heard of such a brutal and shocking injustice that I cared so little about. Next witness.
",65,4,11
"13754","Kif: Bender the robot, please take the stand.
",65,4,11
"13755","Fry: She's all yours, buddy!
",65,4,11
"13756","Bender: I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good.
",65,4,11
"13757","Zapp: Please use the beeps.
",65,4,11
"13758","Fry: Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned.
",65,4,11
"13759","Nimoy: I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
",65,4,11
"13760","Fry: You know. 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones.
",65,4,11
"13761","Nimoy: Oh, really, I've done too many things to remember one particular TV series. But if-if you want to discuss my books of poetry--
",65,4,11
"13762","Fry: Come on! Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
",65,4,11
"13763","Nimoy: No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!
",65,4,11
"13764","Fry: Aha! You can't escape it!
",65,4,11
"13765","Nimoy: [crying] Oh, you're right, I can't.
",65,4,11
"13766","Fry: Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK, I outwitted you, but--
",65,4,11
"13767","Nimoy: [crying] No, it's my fellow cast members. 300 years ago they left Earth behind.
",65,4,11
"13768","Shatner: This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, Leonard.
",65,4,11
"13769","Nimoy: Bill, you are, and always shall be, my friend. But I just signed a six-month lease on my apartment. I can't walk away from a commitment like that.
",65,4,11
"13770","Shatner: Very well, my friend.
",65,4,11
"13771","Nimoy: [crying] Why did the world turn it's back on our obvious greatness?
",65,4,11
"13772","Fry: I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
",65,4,11
"13773","Nimoy: Oh!
",65,4,11
"13774","Frakes: Yes! Front row!
",65,4,11
"13775","Leela: You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!
",65,4,11
"13776","Fry: But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
",65,4,11
"13777","Leela: But it's set 800 years in the past!
",65,4,11
"13778","Bender: Yeah, why is this so important to you?
",65,4,11
"13779","Fry: 'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did.
",65,4,11
"13780","Leela: Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone.
",65,4,11
"13781","Bender: I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course.
",65,4,11
"13782","Leela: We're entering the Omega system.
",65,4,11
"13783","Computer Voice: Warning: You are now in forbidden space.
",65,4,11
"13784","Bender: Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? [sarcastic] Ooh, I'm so scared!
",65,4,11
"13785","Leela: I've lost control of the ship!
",65,4,11
"13786","Fry: Oh, dip!
",65,4,11
"13787","Nimoy: Dip, indeed!
",65,4,11
"13788","Fry: It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
",65,4,11
"13789","Nimoy: So many cardboard sets, so many memories. If only the others--
",65,4,11
"13790","Shatner: I guess that's my cue.
",65,4,11
"13791","Nimoy: Bill!
",65,4,11
"13792","Shatner: L-Dog!
",65,4,11
"13793","Nimoy: [laughing] Hey! This is wonderful!
",65,4,11
"13794","Shatner: Oh, man.
",65,4,11
"13795","Nimoy: I feel like hugging you.
",65,4,11
"13796","Shatner: Well I would except you have no body! [Nimoy laughs.] And we're both men.
",65,4,11
"13797","Nimoy: Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest! [A token redshirt steps out.] Welshie!
",65,4,11
"13798","Fry: Welshie?
",65,4,11
"13799","Nichols: We did some musical reunion specials in the 2200's but the guy who played Scotty had trouble yodelling.
",65,4,11
"13800","Takei: Ever since then, Welshie has been a welcome participant in our escapades.
",65,4,11
"13801","Fry: I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
",65,4,11
"13802","Shatner: We were on our way to Welshie's cousin's house to stay in the guest room when our ship was pulled down to this planet and crashed, just like yours.
",65,4,11
"13803","Koenig: When we woke up, we had these bodies.
",65,4,11
"13804","Fry: Say it in Russian!
",65,4,11
"13805","Koenig: Ven vee voke up vee had these wodies.
",65,4,11
"13806","Fry: Now say ""nuclear wessels""!
",65,4,11
"13807","Koenig: No!
",65,4,11
"13808","Takei: You'll love it here. Everything is provided for us, and we never age. Check out these abs!
",65,4,11
"13809","Bender: Yowza!
",65,4,11
"13810","Leela: But who's doing all this for you?
",65,4,11
"13811","Shatner: You know, we never thought about it. We're famous celebrities -- we're used to this sort of treatment.
",65,4,11
"13812","Melllvar: It is I!
",65,4,11
"13813","Bender: Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
",65,4,11
"13814","Melllvar: I am not an effect! You doubt my power?
",65,4,11
"13815","Bender: I do.
",65,4,11
"13816","Welshie: [shouting] Aye!
",65,4,11
"13817","Fry: [screaming] Welshie!
",65,4,11
"13818","Zapp: This court will now hear some very sensual testimony from this court's ex-lover, Turanga Leela.
",65,4,11
"13819","Leela: Go [beep] yourself.
",65,4,11
"13820","Melllvar: Behold another power, different from the one you saw earlier.
",65,4,11
"13821","Nimoy: Hey, a body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is mine, alright!
",65,4,11
"13822","Fry: Alright, you gas, what's the deal?
",65,4,11
"13823","Melllvar: Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures of the Enterprise crew rained down upon my planet. Over and over, I watched them. Especially the five with the energy beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, knower of the episodes! Tremble before my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!
",65,4,11
"13824","Fry: Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
",65,4,11
"13825","Melllvar: I beg to differ. [He zaps Welshie some more.] Long have I waited for the one who played Spock. At last, we can begin.
",65,4,11
"13826","Fry: Cool! A Star Trek convention!
",65,4,11
"13827","Nimoy: Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea of how long this is going to last?
",65,4,11
"13828","Melllvar: Until time stops.
",65,4,11
"13829","Leela: What?
",65,4,11
"13830","Shatner: He can't do this!
",65,4,11
"13831","Nimoy: You can't be serious!
",65,4,11
"13832","Melllvar: Now, we have a full schedule of events--
",65,4,11
"13833","Bender: Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?
",65,4,11
"13834","Koenig: Good question!
",65,4,11
"13835","Melllvar: No, you have to stay even longer.
",65,4,11
"13836","Melllvar: Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. ""Melllvar"" has three ""L's"".
",65,4,11
"13837","Takei: I think I've done enough conventions to know how to spell ""Melllvar"".
",65,4,11
"13838","Bender: Say ""nerd""!
",65,4,11
"13839","All: Nerd!
",65,4,11
"13840","Shatner: [spoken-word] I'm Slim Shady,
Yes, I'm the real Shady,
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating,
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up.
",65,4,11
"13841","Koenig: How can you do a spoken-word version of a rap song?
",65,4,11
"13842","Melllvar: He found a way.
",65,4,11
"13843","Leela: For one hundred quatloos: Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
",65,4,11
"13844","Shatner: [shouting] Khaaan!
",65,4,11
"13845","Fry: Uh ... Khan?
",65,4,11
"13846","Leela: Correct.
",65,4,11
"13847","Melllvar: My button has broken. The trivia contest has ended. I-I now have a surprise. You will perform a fan script, written by the ultimate Trek fan.
",65,4,11
"13848","Fry: You have my fan script?
",65,4,11
"13849","Melllvar: I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate fan!
",65,4,11
"13850","Fry: [smug] Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different.
",65,4,11
"13851","Melllvar: Trivia contest over! Take your scripts! [The actors run to a pile of scripts.] We have limited rehearsal time. Now, I didn't make enough copies of the script, so George and Walter will have to share.
",65,4,11
"13852","Leela: Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending.
",65,4,11
"13853","Melllvar: That's right! The ending must not be ruined.
",65,4,11
"13854","Leela: We'll go wait in the ship.
",65,4,11
"13855","Melllvar: OK.
",65,4,11
"13856","Fry: Not till I get my 600 quatloos!
",65,4,11
"13857","Fry: This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
",65,4,11
"13858","Bender: I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
",65,4,11
"13859","Leela: I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?
",65,4,11
"13860","Fry: Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy.
",65,4,11
"13861","Leela: Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.
",65,4,11
"13862","Bender: Like putting too much air in a balloon!
",65,4,11
"13863","Fry: Of course! It's so simple!
",65,4,11
"13864","Shatner: [reading] Alas, my ship, whom I love like a woman, is ... disabled. [He slumps back in his chair and rolls his head.] Oh, Lord!
",65,4,11
"13865","Nimoy: [reading] Fascinating, Captain, and logical too, that we need some help.
",65,4,11
"13866","Takei: [reading] Look, Captain, Melllvar will help us.
",65,4,11
"13867","Koenig: [reading] Keptin, I wope he will welp our ... vessel.
",65,4,11
"13868","Melllvar: Wessel! [Koenig shudders.] You're not acting hard enough!
",65,4,11
"13869","Nimoy: Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much.
",65,4,11
"13870","Shatner: And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because I respected me so much!
",65,4,11
"13871","Bender: [shouting] OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever.
",65,4,11
"13872","Leela: Fire!
",65,4,11
"13873","Nichols: [reading] My, what a handsome energy creature you are. I love you. [The orange beams converge on Melllvar and he screams.] Hey, you wrote it!
",65,4,11
"13874","Leela: It's not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
",65,4,11
"13875","Fry: Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
",65,4,11
"13876","Bender: Yup!
",65,4,11
"13877","Leela: So, uh, how's rehearsal going?
",65,4,11
"13878","Melllvar: Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch of actors while you, a crew of genuine space heroes, risked your lives to save them.
",65,4,11
"13879","Nimoy: Hey! We've done heroic things too.
",65,4,11
"13880","Nichols: Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!
",65,4,11
"13881","Melllvar: Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. I have but one option.
",65,4,11
"13882","Koenig: Keep them and let us go?
",65,4,11
"13883","Melllvar: No! To determine who is more worthy of my fanatical devotion I shall pit you together against each other in armed combat ... to the death!
",65,4,11
"13884","Bender: Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
",65,4,11
"13885","Melllvar: Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77.
",65,4,11
"13886","Fry: Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!
",65,4,11
"13887","Melllvar: I was getting to that one!
",65,4,11
"13888","Zapp: So Melllvar ordered a battle to the death. I assume no one survived.
",65,4,11
"13889","Leela: Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
",65,4,11
"13890","Melllvar: This will be your standard battle to the death. The only weapons: Whatever you can find. But I warn you, do nothing until I have signalled the start of combat. OK, start.
",65,4,11
"13891","Koenig: I don't have much experience at fighting -- except with you guys.
",65,4,11
"13892","Shatner: I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode where I threw my shoe at the enemy?
",65,4,11
"13893","Nimoy: You mean Doohan?
",65,4,11
"13894","Shatner: Whoever it was, I did it like this.
",65,4,11
"13895","Takei: Ow!
",65,4,11
"13896","Shatner: My foot's cold!
",65,4,11
"13897","Leela: There. We can make these into spears.
",65,4,11
"13898","Fry: And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
",65,4,11
"13899","Bender: And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw! [He pulls out a Tommy gun from behind a rock and expends the entire round. Fry and Leela glare at him and he chuckles.] That was fun!
",65,4,11
"13900","Nichols: What if I distract them with my famous fan dance?
",65,4,11
"13901","Shatner: Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And then, George, you give them a karate chop!
",65,4,11
"13902","Takei: I find that offensive. Just because I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume I know karate. Have I ever led you to believe I've studied karate?
",65,4,11
"13903","Shatner: Well, no, but you never talk about yourself.
",65,4,11
"13904","Takei: [sad] Maybe if you showed a little interest.
",65,4,11
"13905","Fry: Well, here goes nothing.
",65,4,11
"13906","Nichols: [sexfully] Hello, boys!
",65,4,11
"13907","Bender: Whoa!
",65,4,11
"13908","Takei: Hi-yah!
",65,4,11
"13909","Shatner: There's no right way to hit a woman.
",65,4,11
"13910","Leela: Then do it the wrong way.
",65,4,11
"13911","Shatner: Fine. Yah!
",65,4,11
"13912","Leela: Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
",65,4,11
"13913","Shatner: See you in h--
",65,4,11
"13914","Bender: Come on, Walter!
",65,4,11
"13915","Nimoy: Take that!
",65,4,11
"13916","Fry: It hurts!
",65,4,11
"13917","Nimoy: Let's see if this actually works! [He tries to do the Vulcan neck pinch on Bender but it doesn't work.] Hm. [Bender punches him, grabs his legs and swings him around, whacking the others in the face.] Ow! Ow! Ow!
",65,4,11
"13918","Koenig: My face!
",65,4,11
"13919","Takei: Ow! My face too!
",65,4,11
"13920","Shatner: May I? [Leela grabs him and throws him over her head.] Oh!
",65,4,11
"13921","Melllvar: Excellent! Excellent!
",65,4,11
"13922","Shatner: Leela, please. This is exactly what Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers. Can't we resolve our differences some other way?
",65,4,11
"13923","Melllvar's Mother: Melllvar! Dinner time!
",65,4,11
"13924","Melllvar: Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!
",65,4,11

",65,4,11
"13926","Fry: All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child.
",65,4,11

",65,4,11
"13928","Bender: Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!
",65,4,11
"13929","Fry: Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together.
",65,4,11
"13930","Shatner: I love you so much!
",65,4,11
"13931","Nimoy: Hello?
",65,4,11
"13932","Fry: We've decided to work together.
",65,4,11
"13933","Nimoy: Uh, so did they.
",65,4,11
"13934","Shatner: Now, how do we escape?
",65,4,11
"13935","Leela: We can't use our ship; we have life support but the engines are wrecked.
",65,4,11
"13936","Takei: Ironic, because our engines work but our life support systems don't.
",65,4,11
"13937","Leela: Hey, if your engines work--
",65,4,11
"13938","Takei: And your life support systems work--
",65,4,11
"13939","Fry: Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! [to himself] Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you.
",65,4,11
"13940","Leela: We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!
",65,4,11
"13941","Fry: Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?
",65,4,11
"13942","Nimoy: I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.
",65,4,11
"13943","Fry: We did it!
",65,4,11
"13944","Fry: Melllvar's got a spaceship!
",65,4,11
"13945","Melllvar: [on screen] Yes, in mint condition. And you made me take it out of the package!
",65,4,11
"13946","Leela: The Nimbus! We're saved!
",65,4,11
"13947","Zapp: [on screen] You're under arrest. Prepare to be boarded.
",65,4,11
"13948","Zapp: So I boarded you, eh? What happened next?
",65,4,11
"13949","Leela: You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!
",65,4,11
"13950","Leela: One more hit and we're done for!
",65,4,11
"13951","Takei: Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys have a self-destruct code? Like ""destruct sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--""
",65,4,11
"13952","Bender: Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!
",65,4,11
"13953","Melllvar: [on screen] If I can't have the original cast of Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!
",65,4,11
"13954","Fry: Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?
",65,4,11
"13955","Melllvar: [on screen] Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd do without them.
",65,4,11
"13956","Fry: Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After Star Trek, he became an actor.
",65,4,11
"13957","Koenig: Not just an actor, but a well-rounded person, with my own friends and credit cards and keys.
",65,4,11
"13958","Melllvar: [on screen] Well, I guess I could move out of my parents' basement ... maybe get a temp job.
",65,4,11
"13959","Fry: Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.
",65,4,11
"13960","Melllvar: [on screen] I thank you, Fry. You know, you and I are of a kind. In a different reality I could have called you ""friend"".
",65,4,11
"13961","Fry: Episode 10, Balance of Terror.
",65,4,11
"13962","Melllvar: [on screen] More like episode nine, loser! In your face! Victory is mine!
",65,4,11
"13963","Shatner: I wonder, my friends, was he really such an evil energy gas?

",65,4,11

",65,4,11
"13969","Shatner: Let's get the hell outta here!
",65,4,11
"13970","Bender: A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings! [He hits the ball and it interacts with the screen, landing in the lake.] Oh, he slices! Into the water! Oh, man! [He plugs a cable into his head and appears on the screen.] [muttering] Boy, I tell you, buddy!
",66,4,12
"13971","Farnsworth: Bad news, everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission.
",66,4,12

",66,4,12
"13973","Bender: Not good enough!
",66,4,12
"13974","Leela: Why? Says who?
",66,4,12
"13975","Farnsworth: Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
",66,4,12
"13976","Fry: Woo-hoo!
",66,4,12
"13977","Bender: We live to suck another day!
",66,4,12
"13978","Leela: We're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
",66,4,12
"13979","Farnsworth: Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
",66,4,12
"13980","Leela: That doesn't sound so dangerous.
",66,4,12
"13981","Farnsworth: This is no ordinary honey! It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death.
",66,4,12
"13982","Hermes: And that's if you're not allergic. You don't wanna know what happens then. Oh, no, no. God, no!
",66,4,12
"13983","Farnsworth: Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano.
",66,4,12
"13984","Hermes: I didn't want to know!
",66,4,12
"13985","Farnsworth: These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly.
",66,4,12
"13986","Fry: Larger than an American sedan? [He gasps.] How big is the honeycomb?
",66,4,12
"13987","Hermes: Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
",66,4,12
"13988","Bender: It's not small?
",66,4,12
"13989","Hermes: No, no, no.
",66,4,12
"13990","Leela: It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on, boys.
",66,4,12
"13991","Fry: But, Leela, we're no good.
",66,4,12
"13992","Leela: Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself.
",66,4,12
"13993","Fry: I'm not scared of that at all.
",66,4,12
"13994","Leela: Now, bees communicate by dancing.
",66,4,12
"13995","Fry: Like my parents! Oh, wait, that was hitting.
",66,4,12
"13996","Leela: So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
",66,4,12
"13997","Bender: Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance. [He dances.] [in bee] You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it.
",66,4,12
"13998","Leela: Bender, quick! Waggle something!
",66,4,12
"13999","Bender: Uh ... [in bee] Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?
",66,4,12
"14000","Bee: [in bee] Duh!
",66,4,12
"14001","Fry: Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out.
",66,4,12
"14002","Leela: Relax. Everything'll be fine.
",66,4,12
"14003","Fry: Oh, my God! The old Planet Express ship.
",66,4,12
"14004","Leela: There's the black box.
",66,4,12
"14005","Man: [on tape] Captain, the bees have us surrounded! Oh, the Professor was right. We're not as good as his old crew!
",66,4,12
"14006","Captain: [on tape] Well I aim to prove him wrong. It'll take more than a few deadly, deadly bees to-- [The buzzing gets louder.] [screaming] OH, LORD!!
",66,4,12
"14007","Leela: Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static.
",66,4,12
"14008","Bender: Ew!
",66,4,12
"14009","Leela: We found it! The honeycomb hideout.
",66,4,12
"14010","Fry: Hey, what's this goop?
",66,4,12
"14011","Leela: Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
",66,4,12
"14012","Fry: Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make tastes good? [The honeycomb underneath him gives way and he falls into the jelly. He screams.] Help! I can't swim in jelly, as far as I know!
",66,4,12
"14013","Leela: Look! [A small bee floats towards them on the jelly.] It's a baby queen! Aw, she's so cute! You adorable wittle, itty-bitty, fuzzy-wuzzy--
",66,4,12
"14014","Fry: Leela! Stop bonding and let's go! I got jelly in my underpants!
",66,4,12
"14015","Leela: I'm taking this bee with us. With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
",66,4,12
"14016","Bender: [in bee] Pick up the pace, lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks. [The bees glare at Bender, who quickly realises his mistake.] I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.
",66,4,12
"14017","Bee: [in bee] He insulted our fat queen!
",66,4,12
"14018","Queen: [in bee] You try keeping your figure after 10,000 kids!
",66,4,12
"14019","Leela: This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit. Quick!
",66,4,12
"14020","Leela: [shouting] Good luck, Bender!
",66,4,12
"14021","Bender: I'm back, baby!
",66,4,12
"14022","Fry: We made it! We're alive!
",66,4,12
"14023","Leela: Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
",66,4,12
"14024","Fry: Leela, we got lucky this time. But you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
",66,4,12
"14025","Leela: Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away.
",66,4,12
"14026","Fry: Look out! [Leela screams and the bee flies at her. Fry steps in front of her.] You want her, you're gonna have to go through me!
",66,4,12
"14027","Leela: You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry. [There is no response.] [alarmed] Fry?! [Fry is hunched over on the floor, clutching where the sting hit him. Leela gasps.] He's... he's dead!
",66,4,12
"14028","Bender: [crying] Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
",66,4,12
"14029","Leela: [crying] It was all my fault! He died because of me!
",66,4,12
"14030","Farnsworth: [Farnsworth begins patting her on the hand in a comforting manner.] No, no, no, no, no, no. [He turns to Bender.] [shouting] I'm lying to make her feel better!
",66,4,12
"14031","LaBarbara: Husband, can't you go anywhere without lighting something up?
",66,4,12
"14032","Hermes: It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheck.
",66,4,12
"14033","Amy: He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
",66,4,12
"14034","Zoidberg: I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
",66,4,12
"14035","Changstein el Gamahl: I barely knew Philip. But, as a clergyman, I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
",66,4,12
"14036","Hermes: Soothe us with sweet lies.
",66,4,12
"14037","Changstein el Gamahl: It may comfort you to know Fry's death took only 15 seconds. Yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years. And it goes without saying it caused him to empty his bowels. [Everyone gasps.] We now commend Fry's body to the ages.
",66,4,12
"14038","Amy: He's walking on sunshine now.
",66,4,12
"14039","Farnsworth: This makes me the oldest member of my family.
",66,4,12
"14040","Kug: Him do good snu-snu.
",66,4,12
"14041","Bender: All those times I said ""Kill all humans,"" I'd always whisper ""except one"". Fry was that one. [sobbing] And I never told him so!
",66,4,12
"14042","Terry: [melodramatically] Farewell, from the world of tomorrow!
",66,4,12
"14043","Leela: [softly crying] They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain. [She picks up a box marked ""Memories of Fry"" and takes out a collectible spoon from when he was the Trisolian Emperor. She dips it into the jar and eats the honey and begins to become a little light-hearted.] Mmm... It's good. [She eats some more and stops crying.] I feel funny. Ha-ha funny!
",66,4,12
"14044","Fry: Leela?
",66,4,12
"14045","Leela: Fry? I thought you were dead.
",66,4,12
"14046","Fry: Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!
",66,4,12
"14047","Leela: Impressive! But it does sorta support my you-are-dead theory.
",66,4,12
"14048","Fry: Then I'll prove I'm alive, by telling you something only I could know. [A large, translucent image of him appears behind him and Leela and they both speak.] There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left.
",66,4,12
"14049","Leela: It's too beautiful to open. Can I open it?
",66,4,12
"14050","Fry: Sure. There's just one thing I want you to do.
",66,4,12
"14051","Leela: What?
",66,4,12
"14052","Fry: I want you to wake up.
",66,4,12
"14053","Leela: Wake up? But I'm not--
",66,4,12
"14054","Leela: In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
",66,4,12
"14055","Farnsworth: Of course he still exists: As a frozen corpse in outer space! [He laughs then sighs.] Oh, I made myself sad.
",66,4,12
"14056","Leela: Well, here goes.
",66,4,12
"14057","Zoidberg: Bupkis!
",66,4,12
"14058","Bender: Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure.
",66,4,12
"14059","Leela: Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
",66,4,12
"14060","Bender: No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, José! [He opens his chest cabinet and takes out the same gift from Leela's dream.] Here it is.
",66,4,12
"14061","Leela: You took this from Fry's locker?
",66,4,12
"14062","Bender: Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing.
",66,4,12
"14063","Leela: That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
",66,4,12
"14064","Farnsworth: Bull pies!
",66,4,12
"14065","Farnsworth: Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five-pound Ouija board.
",66,4,12
"14066","Leela: Is this some sort of brain scanner?
",66,4,12
"14067","Farnsworth: Some sort, yes. In France it's called a guillotine.
",66,4,12
"14068","Leela: Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
",66,4,12
"14069","Farnsworth: Yes, easily.
",66,4,12
"14070","Bender: Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?
",66,4,12
"14071","Farnsworth: Well, I suppose there's a slim-- [The scanner dings and he gasps.] I don't believe it!
",66,4,12
"14072","Leela: What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
",66,4,12
"14073","Farnsworth: No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back. Remarkable!
",66,4,12
"14074","Leela: But ... my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have known the gift was in Fry's locker?
",66,4,12
"14075","Hermes: Easy! He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind blocked it out.
",66,4,12
"14076","Leela: Are you saying I'm going crazy?
",66,4,12
"14077","Farnsworth: No, no! No one's saying that. But I'm certainly thinking it loudly.
",66,4,12
"14078","Fry: Hi, Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
",66,4,12
"14079","Leela: Shut up! I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
",66,4,12
"14080","Fry: Oh, yeah? [The space around them changes to a purple forest.] Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden?
",66,4,12
"14081","Leela: Well, yes, technically. But it's still very sweet of you.
",66,4,12
"14082","Fry: Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?
",66,4,12
"14083","Leela: Oh, Fry! You must be alive; I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before.
",66,4,12
"14084","Fry: Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold.
",66,4,12
"14085","Leela: Thank you. It's all so beautiful. I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
",66,4,12
"14086","Fry: You can. All you have to do is wake up.
",66,4,12
"14087","Leela: No, no! Don't say that! This is real!
",66,4,12
"14088","Leela: Not another dream! [She gasps and drops the sheets from around her. She is wearing Fry's jacket.] Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
",66,4,12
"14089","Petunia: [from apartment] Quit your bragging! My boyfriend's alive too! [There is a thump.] Not 'nymore!
",66,4,12
"14090","Bender: That's better!
",66,4,12
"14091","Leela: Fry's alive! I have proof!
",66,4,12
"14092","Amy: No way!
",66,4,12
"14093","Farnsworth: You lie!
",66,4,12
"14094","Bender: You do not!
",66,4,12
"14095","Hermes: I'm from Jamaica, the ""Show Me"" island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny.
",66,4,12
"14096","Leela: But he gave me his jacket. Look.
",66,4,12
"14097","Farnsworth: That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red. That's your jacket. An off-the-rack, lime green affair.
",66,4,12
"14098","Leela: But Fry-- His jacket-- And when I woke up it was on me.
",66,4,12
"14099","Hermes: You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela. Here, work it off.
",66,4,12
"14100","Leela: [squeezing] I am not under stress, damnit!
",66,4,12
"14101","Amy: [Farnsworth's voice] Everything's going to be alright, Leela.
",66,4,12
"14102","Leela: What?
",66,4,12
"14103","Amy: I said everything's going to be alright.
",66,4,12
"14104","Leela: Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
",66,4,12
"14105","Bender: A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
",66,4,12
"14106","Leela: I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
",66,4,12
"14107","Farnsworth: You've been taking space honey? Be careful, you purple-haired imbecile!
",66,4,12
"14108","Zoidberg: One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!
",66,4,12
"14109","Hermes: [Farnsworth's voice] Never!
",66,4,12
"14110","Bender: [Amy's voice] Never!
",66,4,12
"14111","Leela: One spoonful to calm me down. [She swallows it and falls over.] OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep. [She eats another one but nothing happens.] Uh-oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. [She swipes at the jar with the spoon but misses and knocks the royal jelly onto the sofa.] Oh, my gosh! I'd better get a sponge. [The jelly forms a Fry-shaped object.] Fry? [She rubs her eye.] Is that you? I don't need a sponge!
",66,4,12
"14112","Fry: Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
",66,4,12
"14113","Farnsworth: Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin--
",66,4,12
"14114","Bender: And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
",66,4,12
"14115","Farnsworth: Yes, Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being.
",66,4,12
"14116","Fry: Neat!
",66,4,12
"14117","Bender: This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again. [He takes Fry's credit cards out of his chest cabinet.] Let's go get hammered!
",66,4,12
"14118","Zoidberg: I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk.
",66,4,12
"14119","Leela: Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.
",66,4,12
"14120","Fry: Me too.
",66,4,12
"14121","Leela: Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
",66,4,12

"14167","Leela: Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me. [She looks around.] Where am I?
",66,4,12
"14168","Fry: In the hospital. The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you.
",66,4,12
"14169","Leela: But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
",66,4,12
"14170","Fry: The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
",66,4,12
"14171","Hermes: Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
",66,4,12
"14172","Bender: You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
",66,4,12
"14173","Amy: The doctor said you'd never wake up.
",66,4,12
"14174","Leela: Really? How long was I out?
",66,4,12
"14175","Amy: Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
",66,4,12
"14176","Zoidberg: And he talked non-stop. Like a parrot of the sea, he was!
",66,4,12
"14177","Fry: I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together. But who knows if it really got through.
",66,4,12
"14178","Leela: It got through, Fry. [She hugs him.] It got through.
",66,4,12
"14179","Leela: [whispering; over credits] You could really use a shower.

Robots from Cyberia, Joe from The Nation of Joe and prisoners from Devil's Island.] Celebrity Ape Fight will return next week at its regular time.
",67,4,13
"14182","Fry: So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court?
",67,4,13
"14183","Amy: How 'bout those guys?
",67,4,13
"14184","Leela: No, they're from the Republic of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them.
",67,4,13
"14185","Farnsworth: Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood. [He, Fry, Leela and Amy get up and leave. They pass some fans holding a ""Go Sweden!"" banner.] Sweden? I don't think so!
",67,4,13
"14186","Hermes: Go on, stick, touch me! Can't do it!
",67,4,13
"14187","LaBarbara: Husband, you haven't been an Olympic-class limbo-er for 20 years! Quit lying to your podgy self.
",67,4,13
"14188","Leela: It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
",67,4,13
"14189","Amy: Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?
",67,4,13
"14190","Hermes: Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport.
",67,4,13
"14191","LaBarbara: That's when they begged my husband to step in and make an ass out of himself.
",67,4,13
"14192","Hermes: And I said I'd try my very best.
",67,4,13
"14193","Fry: But have they seen your ... y'know ... physique, since the old days?
",67,4,13
"14194","Hermes: I described it to them on the phone ... using a series of artful euphemisms.
",67,4,13
"14195","Farnsworth: Don't worry. The fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed. [Hermes wriggles into the bodysuit.] It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees.
",67,4,13
"14196","Hermes: Ooh, that's snug! [Something creaks.] Oh, those haven't descended in years.
",67,4,13
"14197","Farnsworth: Now that's a limbo-er's body!

[A crane drops three unbendable girders into the hands of a robot. The robot bends them with little effort. Bender gasps as he watches. The robot holds up the bent girders.] Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began.

"14201","Female Announcer: [on loudspeaker] Athletes, please take your lanes for the men's 500 metre limbo.
",67,4,13
"14202","Barbados Slim: Hermes Conrad, is that you inside that dumpy little fat man?
",67,4,13
"14203","Hermes: Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
",67,4,13
"14204","Barbados Slim: Yes and I be going back there with a gold medal draped around my elegant Caribbean shoulders.
",67,4,13
"14205","Hermes: Your body may be as perfectly-sculpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met. [He pulls the bodysuit hood over his hair.] But today, I feel lucky.
",67,4,13
"14206","Barbados Slim: I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense!
",67,4,13
"14207","Hermes: That's it, Barbados Slim. You've gone one toke over the line!
",67,4,13
"14208","Man: Limbo-ers, on your marks. Get rubbery. Limbo!
",67,4,13
"14209","Commentator: [voice-over] There they go, and Barbados Slim takes an early lead. God, I hope he wins. [Hermes gasps as he runs.] What's this? Hermes Conrad is closing the gap. He's limbo-ed out of retirement and straight into my heart. I say go to hell, Barbados Slim!
",67,4,13
"14210","Farnsworth: [shouting] Go, bodysuit, go!

",67,4,13
"14214","Commentator: [voice-over] It's Barbados, then Conrad. Conrad pulls ahead! [Hermes pants as he passes Barbados Slim and they go down under the last stick. A ball of flab on Hermes starts to float up the bodysuit. It tears the bodysuit and knocks the limbo stick away. Hermes falls to the ground and Barbados Slim crosses the finish line.] And Conrad is disqualified! Barbados Slim, my hero, takes the gold!
",67,4,13
"14215","LaBarbara: Aw, there, there, Hermes. [She pats his flab.] You did your best. If I'd wanted a human Adonis for a husband, I'd have stayed married to Barbados Slim.
",67,4,13
"14216","Bender: Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead.
",67,4,13
"14217","Female Announcer: [on loudspeaker] Up next, the Fembot bending competition.
",67,4,13
"14218","Bender: Fembots? [He chuckles.] Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace.
",67,4,13
"14219","Bender: What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!
",67,4,13
"14220","Official: Yes but ""Robonia"" sounds like something somebody made up on the spot.

"14221","Bender: Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
",67,4,13
"14222","Commentator: [voice-over] And it's straight! Coilette wins!

"14223","Commentator: [voice-over] Another gold medal for the spunky maid from Robonia.
",67,4,13
"14224","Commentator: [voice-over] A perfect bend and a flawless entry. No splash at all! [Three robot officials hold up their scores. A 10.0, another 10.0 and a 9.9. Bender's dress falls revealing his underwear and the last judge changes his score to 10.0.] Perfect scores! A record five gold medals for Coilette!
",67,4,13
"14225","Bender: I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!
",67,4,13
"14226","Female Announcer: [on loudspeaker] All medallists report for gender testing.

",67,4,13
"14229","Farnsworth: Oh, I think we should just stay friends.
",67,4,13
"14230","Bender: I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
",67,4,13
"14231","Farnsworth: Bender, a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well, let's get started!

"14236","Bender: [whispering] C'mon!
",67,4,13
"14237","Fry: I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However, I will watch out of curiosity.

"14238","Farnsworth: [shouting] Quiet! [talking] I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender, delicate form.
",67,4,13
"14239","Farnsworth: Draining male oil. [Oil pours out of Bender into a tray. Amy faints. Farnsworth hooks up a tin of Femmzoil.] Infusing female oil. [Bender looks worried. Farnsworth holds up some shears.] Removing item.

"14246","Coilette: I'm just out there making us ladies look good.
",67,4,13
"14247","Amy: Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
",67,4,13
"14248","Fry: But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
",67,4,13
"14249","Coilette: Of course not.
",67,4,13
"14250","Farnsworth: Dear Lord! A coaster! The Femmzoil must be sachet-ing girlishly into your processor.
",67,4,13
"14251","Coilette: Then change me back. My breasts are keeping me awake at night anyway. [The phone rings. Coilette giggles and skips over to it. She picks it up.] Hello? What? A guest spot on Late Night With Humorbot 5.0? I'd love to! [She gasps.] My own limo? No I don't have my own limo. You'd better send one. [She hangs up.] I need a rain check on that nad-swap, Professor. I'm going on TV. C'mon, Fry. Help me pick out a pantsuit.

"14252","Humorbot 5.0: So, Calculon, do you want to set up this clip from All My Circuits?

"14254","Calculon: [melodramatically; on TV] Nooo!
",67,4,13
"14255","Calculon: Funny story: The script called for me to say ""yes"" but I gave it a little twist.
",67,4,13
"14256","Humorbot 5.0: Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found. Please put your hands together for my next guest. Winner of five Olympic medals, Coilette from Robonia. [Enter Coilette.

",67,4,13
"14257","Coilette: Yes, Humorbot. If you ask me, women today are too stuck up to go out and jiggle their Jello like everybody wants them to. In fact, should I do it now?

",67,4,13
"14258","Calculon: Madam, I am one impressed celebrity.

",67,4,13
"14264","Calculon: But I would be honoured if you would join me for dinner sometime.

",67,4,13
"14266","Calculon: Of course I would.
",67,4,13
"14267","Coilette: This top makes me look fat. Is it trampy to go on a first date nude?

"14268","Amy: Yes.
",67,4,13
"14269","Coilette: Perfect.
",67,4,13
"14270","Fry: You gotta tell me: You're not actually attracted to Calculon, right? And if you are, don't tell me. Are you?
",67,4,13
"14271","Coilette: Certainly not. But just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Is that so much to ask?
",67,4,13
"14272","Leela: Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
",67,4,13
"14273","Coilette: Are you kidding? I need more lipstick! Much more! [She pastes it on around her mouth.] Ooh, yeah! That's the stuff! Men love it when you really glob it on.

"14274","Leela: No, they don't.
",67,4,13
"14275","Amy: No way!
",67,4,13
"14276","Coilette: Oh, please! Every man wants a tramp. No wonder you girls aren't married. [She giggles.] I tell you, men are so much better at being women.

"14277","Fry: But what if he wants to-- I mean, if he tries to ... uh ... Barry White?
",67,4,13
"14278","Coilette: I'll just tell him I need a commitment first. That'll stick a potato in his tailpipe!

"14279","Hermes: Good Lord, man! What kind of temporary woman are you?
",67,4,13
"14280","Coilette: Look, why don't all of you just back off? Can't a girl enjoy herself without being judged?
",67,4,13
"14281","Farnsworth: Oh, dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women. Particularly you, Leela.
",67,4,13
"14282","Leela: I'm worried about him too, Professor.
",67,4,13
"14283","Elzar: Hey, ma'am, you sure can put it away! You saved me a trip to the dump. Bam!

",67,4,13
"14286","Calculon: You know, Coilette, I've never before met a woman as fascinating as I am. You're such a sweet, soft Fembot. And you have this free spirit about you. [Coilette belches fire.] And there it is. It's as if you understand the male mind better than I! [He strokes her hand.] I've never met anyone like you.

"14292","Amy: No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop! [She points to the gifts, a cheque for ""Cash"" and a vase of puppies on the table.] I think Calculon's falling for you.
",67,4,13
"14293","Coilette: Bah! Any day now he'll dump me for a new wad of arm candy. And then I can turn back into a guy and hock all this stuff! It's just a game.
",67,4,13
"14294","Calculon: Coilette, I can't stop thinking about you. I can't sleep at night, although, as a robot, I don't do that anyway. But if I did I couldn't because I love you so. [Enter Boxy.] Oh, my darling ... [Calculon opens Boxy's head, takes out a ring and goes down on his knees.] ... Will you marry me?

"14295","Coilette: Oh, Calculon! Yes, I will!
",67,4,13
"14296","Amy: [whispering] Maybe she's right about the lipstick.

"14299","Fry: Cool. What's for dinner?
",67,4,13
"14300","Leela: What do you mean ""a scam""?
",67,4,13
"14301","Coilette: I marry Calculon, divorce him, take half his money and turn back into a guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid scheme.
",67,4,13
"14302","Fry: That's marriage alright!
",67,4,13
"14303","Leela: That is so unbelievably manipulative.
",67,4,13
"14304","Coilette: Come on! You never went on a date with a guy just 'cause you were hungry?
",67,4,13
"14305","Leela: Well I, uh, I thought I might like him on a full stomach.

",67,4,13

"14309","Coilette: A remote control? You got me a TV?
",67,4,13
"14310","Calculon: No, my dearest, it's the remote control to my heart. It symbolises the power you have to sway my emotions.
",67,4,13
"14311","Coilette: Will it work on my TV?
",67,4,13
"14312","Calculon: We don't need TVs, we have each other! Coilette, if I weren't able to spend my life with you I would leap from this very balloon.

"14313","Coilette: Come on with that. Really?
",67,4,13
"14314","Calculon: Yes! We were meant to be.

"14316","Calculon: So much so that I'm prepared to give up showbusiness itself to be with you.
",67,4,13
"14317","Coilette: But, you always said you'd rather burn down a convent than give up showbusiness.
",67,4,13
"14318","Calculon: I always said many things. But now all I want is a peaceful life and a quiet villa overlooking a vineyard ... with you.

"14325","Fry: So now you do wanna marry him?

"14330","Coilette: [crying] Uh-huh.
",67,4,13
"14331","Leela: Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain.

"14340","Calculon: Is there a doctor in the--
",67,4,13
"14341","Zoidberg: I came as soon as I could. [He puts a stethoscope to Coilette's head and gasps.] It appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever!

",67,4,13
"14343","Coilette: Whatever happens, remember, the flame of my eternal love will burn forever.
",67,4,13

"14362","Fry: Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals.
",67,4,13
"14363","Coilette: It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.

"14402","Mom: Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year in a row, the future of robotics has arrived. Boys? [Walt, Larry and Igner come up in the middle of the stage in a puff of smoke.] I give you ... Robot 1-X!

",68,4,14
"14405","Bender: Neat!
",68,4,14
"14406","Mom: Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all my previous models to shame. Incidentally, would one of my previous models mind coming up here?
",68,4,14
"14407","Bender: Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!
",68,4,14
"14408","Refreshment-bot: Jerk!
",68,4,14
"14409","Bender: Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom.
",68,4,14
"14410","Mom: Notice that this obsolete robot runs on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.
",68,4,14
"14411","Bender: Man, that smells great!
",68,4,14
"14412","Mom: Now, let's see how both robots do at a typical household task: Sorting a jar of pocket change.
",68,4,14
"14413","Robot 1-X: Task completed. Total value, $4.73 and one Albanian lek.
",68,4,14
"14414","Mom: Very good, Robot 1-X. And you, bending unit?
",68,4,14
"14415","Bender: Uh, I never got the change. [He sniggers.] Suckers.

"14416","Mom: Presenting Mom's Friendly Robots.
",68,4,14
"14417","Bender: That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!
",68,4,14
"14418","Farnsworth: Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
",68,4,14
"14419","Bender: [hoarse] Eep!
",68,4,14
"14420","Leela: Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?
",68,4,14
"14421","Robot 1-X: I can and will.
",68,4,14
"14422","Bender: Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me.
",68,4,14
"14423","Leela: I asked you five minutes ago.
",68,4,14

",68,4,14
"14434","Bender: Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
",68,4,14
"14435","Amy: Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV.

"14436","Bender: I can't. I'm stuck in the can.

",68,4,14

",68,4,14
"14439","Leela: Why can't you accept his help?
",68,4,14
"14440","Bender: I hate him.
",68,4,14
"14441","Leela: But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
",68,4,14
"14442","Bender: I can't ask for his help because--
",68,4,14
"14443","Farnsworth: Yes?
",68,4,14
"14444","Bender: [whispering] I'm scared of him.
",68,4,14
"14445","Leela: Oh, sorry.
",68,4,14
"14446","Farnsworth: Well then there's only one solution: You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
",68,4,14
"14447","Bender: An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?
",68,4,14
"14448","Fry: Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.
",68,4,14
"14449","Bender: Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?
",68,4,14
"14450","Farnsworth: Yes! For God's sakes, yes!

"14451","Bender: [crying] Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
",68,4,14

",68,4,14
"14453","Bender: Yeah! Right on, nutcake!
",68,4,14
"14454","Roberto: Parole officer says I gotta upgrade or he won't give me back my stabbing knife. But it's no big. I hate those 1-X so much I know it won't affect me. [A piece of machinery grabs him and lifts him off the conveyor belt and puts him on the upgrade machine. His arms are clamped to the machine and something comes down around his face.] Death to the 1-X robots! [The technician throws a switch and the upgrade starts. Electricity zaps around Roberto's head then stops. The machine around his face comes away.] I love those magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots are my friends.
",68,4,14
"14455","Bender: W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
",68,4,14
"14456","Roberto: I'm past that. Later, blood!
",68,4,14
"14457","Bender: It's like he's not him anymore. [He is placed on the upgrade machine. The technician resets it.] You took away his robo-humanity. [The technician throws the switch and Fatbot trembles as Bender is upgraded.] I changed my mind!
",68,4,14
"14458","Bender: I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life? [The seagull squawks.] I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it. [He cries and walks over to a ""Boating Prohibited"" sign, rips it down and folds it into a boat. He climbs into it and pushes it away from the riverbank.] And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner. [He sails away from the land towards and storm.] Oh, jeez!
",68,4,14
"14459","Bender: [shouting] Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
",68,4,14
"14460","Bender: Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter. [He walks across the beach, lies down, picks up a rock and dumps it on top of him.] There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while.
",68,4,14
"14461","Bender: Damn. One rock short of rescue!
",68,4,14
"14462","Bender: Oop! Low on power. [He chuckles.] Better fuel up! [The bottle is empty.] Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze.
",68,4,14
"14463","Bender: Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps.
",68,4,14
"14464","Bender: Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around.
",68,4,14
"14465","Bender: Beer! [He throws the rock off him. The beer is a hallucination and is nothing more than six birds trapped in a six pack ring. Bender tries to pull one out and it bites him.] Ow!
",68,4,14
"14466","Bender: Who ... is ... it? [A coconut drops on his head.] Ow!
",68,4,14
"14467","Bender: Who are you and why should I care?
",68,4,14
"14468","Cartridge Unit: [mechanical voice] Side A. [normal voice] We're a community of outdated robots who refused to upgrade and came here-- [He takes the cartridge out, flips it over and puts it back in.] [mechanical voice] Side B. [normal voice] To live a simpler existence, free of technology.
",68,4,14
"14469","Bender: A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
",68,4,14
"14470","Cartridge Unit: Your mother.
",68,4,14
"14471","Lisa: What Cartridge Unit means is the very things that make us obsolete also make us unique. I, for example, need to keep refilling my waterwheel or I'll power down forever. [Her wheel runs dry and she panics.] [screaming] Oh, God! I'll never make it this time! This is the end! [She runs down the beach and into the sea. The wheel refills and she walks out.] [talking] Anyway, we like it here.
",68,4,14
"14472","Bender: Like you have a choice. [He turns to the other robot, a Sinclair 2K.] So what's your problem?
",68,4,14
"14473","Sinclair: Not enough... uh--
",68,4,14
"14474","Bender: Memory?
",68,4,14
"14475","Sinclair: Oh, great. Now I remember that word but I forgot my wife's face.
",68,4,14
"14476","Lisa: [screaming] Oh, God, no! I want to live! [She leaps into the water again then calmly returns to the group.] [talking] If you'd like, you're welcome to join our society.
",68,4,14
"14477","Bender: Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?
",68,4,14
"14478","Sinclair: Why would you wanna watch TV when you can watch a snail crawl for hours on end?

"14482","Sinclair: Way to go!
",68,4,14
"14483","Bender: That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party! [He takes a CD out of his chest cabinet and puts it in his mouth, which acts as a CD player. He starts dancing to Kenny Loggins' I'm Alright.] Yeah, baby! C'mon!
",68,4,14
"14484","Lisa: Where did you get that CD?
",68,4,14
"14485","Bender: It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!
",68,4,14
"14486","Lisa: CDs are unnatural. Why don't you just listen to the ocean?
",68,4,14
"14487","Bender: Which ocean? That ocean? [He turns around and listens.] Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet, salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage. [He empties the other discs out of his chest cabinet and stamps on them, cracking and breaking them.] Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!
",68,4,14
"14488","Bender: Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey.
",68,4,14
"14489","Lisa: Hi, Bender. We know how much you miss technology, so we brought you this washing machine that drifted ashore.
",68,4,14
"14490","Bender: Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w-- [He turns around and sees the robots staring at him. He stands up and closes the door and looks around at the simple beach huts and the mother boar feeding her children. He picks up the washing machine and throws it into the bay.] You--!

"14491","Lisa: What? I don't understand.
",68,4,14
"14492","Sinclair: Is he alright?

",68,4,14
"14547","Technician: Your upgrade is complete.
",68,4,14
"14548","Bender: But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
",68,4,14
"14549","Technician: [shrugging] Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.
",68,4,14
"14550","Bender: Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?
",68,4,14
"14551","Technician: No, get out. [He presses a button and the conveyor belt starts up.] Next.
",68,4,14
"14552","Bender: Well, I guess reality is what you make of it. [He crosses the road and walks down a flower-lined path with a white horse and lush trees nearby. He takes out a cigar and a fairy lights it for him.] Oh, thanks, baby!
",68,4,14
"14553","Farnsworth: [shouting; from inside] Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!
",69,4,15
"14554","Fry: [shouting] I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?
",69,4,15
"14555","Leela: [shouting] Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on.
",69,4,15
"14556","Farnsworth: [shouting; from attic] Buddha! Zeus! God! One of you guys do something!
",69,4,15
"14557","Fry: [shouting] Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?
",69,4,15
"14558","Farnsworth: [shouting; from attic] Help! Satan! You owe me!
",69,4,15
"14559","Leela: [shouting] Look, um, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to: I can't go out tonight because... [The shaking stops but Leela still shouts.] I have sweaty boot rash.
",69,4,15
"14560","Amy: No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
",69,4,15
"14561","Fry: So, will you go out with me?
",69,4,15
"14562","Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. I'm still technically alive. Yes! [He lifts something up off the floor.] But I need to you to dispose of this crazy-ass experiment that almost killed me. [He puts a box on the table.] You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction.
",69,4,15
"14563","Bender: I can hit it with a shovel.
",69,4,15
"14564","Farnsworth: That's not good enough.
",69,4,15
"14565","Bender: This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.
",69,4,15
"14566","Farnsworth: Yes, yes.
",69,4,15
"14567","Zoidberg: So what's in the box, already?
",69,4,15
"14568","Farnsworth: No peeking! [He hits Zoidberg with a hammer. Zoidberg cries out in pain.] I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it.
",69,4,15
"14569","Hermes: Ow! You hurt my collator!
",69,4,15
"14570","Farnsworth: I don't care. [He stands up.] Listen well: No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden! [He shakes his fist in the air then rubs the lid.] Pretty tantalising though!
",69,4,15
"14571","Fry: Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted.
",69,4,15
"14572","Zoidberg: In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni! [He clasps his claws together.] What a day that was! [He screams and pushes Fry and Bender out of the way.] [shouting] Give me the box!
",69,4,15
"14573","Hermes: Scram, you lousy green snakes! [Fry, Bender and Zoidberg run out.] Here, Leela. Take this and use it to shoot those guys.
",69,4,15
"14574","Leela: Right. If they try to look in the box.
",69,4,15
"14575","Hermes: Whatever.
",69,4,15
"14576","Fry: Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
",69,4,15
"14577","Bender: Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?
",69,4,15
"14578","Fry: No.
",69,4,15
"14579","Bender: That's what makes it so funny! [He laughs then suddenly stops.] OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me.
",69,4,15
"14580","Fry: [from vent] Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting.
",69,4,15
"14581","Bender: We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive.
",69,4,15
"14582","Fry: Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them.
",69,4,15
"14583","Bender: And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!
",69,4,15
"14584","Leela: That oughta keep those dopes occupied. [She stands up and pulls a sheet off something.] I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
",69,4,15
"14585","Leela: Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek. [She sighs.] I need coffee. [She walks to the coffee machine and is about to put the coin in but looks back at the box.] OK, heads I look, tails I don't. [She flips the coin and covers it. She lifts her hand and smiles.] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Heads! I mean, alright then. No! I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would. [She lifts the lid off the box and puts her head inside.] Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be.
",69,4,15
"14586","Leela A: Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!
",69,4,15
"14587","Fry 1: Leela, what have you done?
",69,4,15
"14588","Leela A: Nothing. What do you mean ""Why was I looking in the box?""
",69,4,15
"14589","Fry 1: I mean your hair. It's all different-y.
",69,4,15
"14590","Leela A: Bender? Is that you?
",69,4,15
"14591","Bender 1: You know it! Large and in charge!
",69,4,15
"14592","Farnsworth 1: Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box.
",69,4,15
"14593","Leela A: I didn't dye my hair. This is how I always look.
",69,4,15
"14594","Bender 1: No, that's how you always look. [Another Leela walks in carrying a mug. Her hair is red and her trousers are tinged red.] This throws my entire perception of reality into question. Clone? Robot? Or long-lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer video poker.
",69,4,15
"14595","Fry 1: It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! Get him!
",69,4,15
"14596","Leela A: Hold it! You have this all wrong. I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow.
",69,4,15
"14597","Fry 1: You shut up, sir!
",69,4,15
"14598","Farnsworth 1: No, wait! I've got it. I know what's in the box. Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.
",69,4,15
"14599","Fry 1: Am not!
",69,4,15
"14600","Farnsworth 1: It contains a parallel universe. And when you create a parallel universe, it's almost always populated by evil twins.
",69,4,15
"14601","Leela A: Now, look: I am not evil. My loan officer said so.
",69,4,15
"14602","Farnsworth 1: Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say Evil-a?
",69,4,15
"14603","Bender 1: Oh, this is awful. Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me. I do my best, damnit!
",69,4,15
"14604","Farnsworth 1: Leela? [Both Leelas look at him.] Uh, the good Leela. [Leela 1 smiles.] I want you to snoop around the other universe and find out how evil they are. [He hands her Hermes' laser.] Here.
",69,4,15
"14605","Leela A: I tell you they're not evil. But don't be confused. They are jerks.
",69,4,15
"14606","Zoidberg A: [from Universe A] Hello!
",69,4,15
"14607","Leela 1: [from Universe A] Hi-yah!
",69,4,15
"14608","Zoidberg A: [from Universe A] Ow!
",69,4,15
"14609","Leela 1: Come out of your universe with your hands up!
",69,4,15
"14610","Fry A: Oh, wow! It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip.
",69,4,15
"14611","Farnsworth A: Astonishing! I must have created a parallel universe.
",69,4,15
"14612","Farnsworth 1: Baldercrap! I created your universe. All you created was my fist parallel to your face.
",69,4,15
"14613","Farnsworth A: Ow.
",69,4,15
"14614","Leela A: Look, it doesn't matter who created what. The important thing is-- Yah!
",69,4,15
"14615","Leela 1: [whispering] We're exactly the same. I know all her moves. Therefore, I've got the upper hand.
",69,4,15
"14616","Farnsworth 1: Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
",69,4,15
"14617","Farnsworth A: Let's recap what's happened so far. [He presses a button and a hologram appears over the table.] As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe.
",69,4,15
"14618","Farnsworth 1: While I, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe.
",69,4,15
"14619","Leela A: This is getting confusing. Why don't we call our universe ""Universe A"" and this universe ""Universe B""?
",69,4,15
"14620","Bender 1: Hey! Why can't we be Universe A?
",69,4,15
"14621","Fry 1: Yeah!
",69,4,15
"14622","Amy 1: Yeah!
",69,4,15
"14623","Farnsworth 1: We want A!
",69,4,15
"14624","Zoidberg 1: It's the best letter!
",69,4,15
"14625","Fry A: We called it first. Besides, this place kinda feels like a ""B"", y'know?
",69,4,15
"14626","Leela 1: Alright, you can be crummy Universe A and we'll be Universe 1.
",69,4,15
"14627","Fry 1: Or ""The Mongooses"". That's a cool team name. The Fighting Mongooses!
",69,4,15
"14628","Farnsworth A: Wait a second. If everyone is identical, why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?
",69,4,15
"14629","Leela 1: Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin. It came up tails so I didn't look.
",69,4,15
"14630","Leela A: That's weird. Mine came up heads, so I did.
",69,4,15
"14631","Farnsworth A: Interesting. Apparently, the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes.
",69,4,15
"14632","Bender A: That explains fruity here! [He points at Bender 1.] I tossed a coin to pick my finish. Fog hat grey!
",69,4,15
"14633","Bender 1: Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!
",69,4,15
"14634","Farnsworth A: You people and your slight differences disgust me. I'm going home. Where's that blue box with our universe in it?
",69,4,15
"14635","Farnsworth 1: Oh, you'd like to get back to your evil universe, wouldn't you? And destroy your box with our universe inside it.
",69,4,15
"14636","Farnsworth A: Nonsense! I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that!
",69,4,15
"14637","Farnsworth 1: Wha?
",69,4,15
"14638","Farnsworth A: You heard me!
",69,4,15
"14639","Farnsworth 1: In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden until I'm convinced you're not evil. [He turns to his staff.] Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart.
",69,4,15
"14640","Farnsworth A: And you all do the same!
",69,4,15
"14641","Leela 1: Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together? We have plans tonight.
",69,4,15
"14642","Leela A: [stunned] You guys are dating?!
",69,4,15
"14643","Fry 1: Oh, no, no. We're married.
",69,4,15
"14644","Bender A: I've got my eye on you, boy!
",69,4,15
"14645","Bender 1: Don't even think about it, lunch-pail! You'd be dead before you hit the ground.
",69,4,15
"14646","Bender A: Good point. Whattya say we just hit a strip joint?
",69,4,15
"14647","Bender 1: I was waitin' for one of us to say that! [They cheer.] Bender A, you're a prince among robots. Can you forgive me for distrusting you?
",69,4,15
"14648","Bender A: Aw! I can't stay mad at what is essentially me. I love me!
",69,4,15
"14649","Amy 1: This is so great! I always wanted an imaginary friend!
",69,4,15
"14650","Amy A: I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel. We're exactly the same, right down to the-- [She sees Amy 1's toes.] Splech! Is that pink nail polish?
",69,4,15
"14651","Amy 1: Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's right, you are evil. And shallow.
",69,4,15
"14652","Amy A: I am not evil!
",69,4,15
"14653","Leela A: So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?
",69,4,15
"14654","Fry 1: Funny story. I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me.
",69,4,15
"14655","Leela 1: I'd make up stuff like ""I have sweaty boot rash"" or ""I have to meet the President""!
",69,4,15
"14656","Fry 1: Oh, man, you never heard such excuses! But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking back on it now, it's kinda funny.
",69,4,15
"14657","Fry A: [sarcastic] It sure is. Right, Leela? Funny. Ha ha ha ha!
",69,4,15
"14658","Leela 1: Then one night, when Fry asked me out, the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I always do in those situations.
",69,4,15
"14659","Leela A: Oh, Lord...
",69,4,15
"14660","Leela 1: I flipped a coin. It came up heads and we went out.
",69,4,15
"14661","Fry A: You mean you flipped a coin too? And it was tails? So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost.
",69,4,15
"14662","Leela 1: You really missed out on something, Leela. That date was magical.
",69,4,15
"14663","Fry 1: One year later, I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married.
",69,4,15
"14664","Leela A: Ooh!
",69,4,15
"14665","Fry A: One year later, I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie!
",69,4,15
"14666","Farnsworth 1: Well, that was pointless.
",69,4,15
"14667","Farnsworth A: Say, I hope you won't think it ""evil"" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound.
",69,4,15
"14668","Farnsworth 1: Oh, this old thing? I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain.
",69,4,15
"14669","Farnsworth A: Of course! I had the same idea. I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed. But it came up tails, so I didn't. How'd it go?
",69,4,15
"14670","Farnsworth 1: Well getting the brain out was the easy part. The hard part was getting the brain out!
",69,4,15
"14671","Farnsworth A: Oh, you!
",69,4,15
"14672","Zoidberg 1: So, tell me about yourself.
",69,4,15
"14673","Zoidberg A: Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor. Ooh! A can!
",69,4,15
"14674","Zoidberg 1: As for me, I design mansions, then live in them. [He bursts into tears.] [crying] I'm lying! I'm an appalling failure!
",69,4,15
"14675","Zoidberg A: [crying] Me too! A big, fat one!
",69,4,15
"14676","Zoidberg 1: And those co-workers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs. What are they, from Nob Hill?
",69,4,15
"14677","Zoidberg A: They're all like ""Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg!"" ""Put on pants, Zoidberg!"" ""Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg!""
",69,4,15
"14678","Zoidberg 1: Oh, that box! Too good for us, is it?
",69,4,15
"14679","Zoidberg A: Bah! Someday they'll watch from down in the gutter, they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box.
",69,4,15
"14680","Zoidberg 1: You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box.
",69,4,15
"14681","Farnsworth 1: Good news, everyones!
",69,4,15
"14682","Farnsworth A: After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil.
",69,4,15
"14683","Farnsworth 1: Yes, the Bible is the real good news. Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe.
",69,4,15
"14684","Hermes 1: What's goin' on here? Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?
",69,4,15
"14685","Leela 1: Hermes, aren't you curious about the fact that there's two of everybody?
",69,4,15
"14686","Hermes 1: No. Now like my granny used to say back in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself.""
",69,4,15
"14687","Farnsworth 1: Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here.
",69,4,15
"14688","Farnsworth A: Oh, go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe...
",69,4,15
"14689","Farnsworth 1: Then your Hermes...
",69,4,15
"14690","Farnsworth A: Oh, my!
",69,4,15
"14691","Narrator: [voice-over] And sure enough...
",69,4,15
"14692","Hermes: Like Granny said, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."" God rest her zombie bones.
",69,4,15
"14693","Leela A: So we go back through the box and stop Hermes?
",69,4,15
"14694","Farnsworth A: Right. Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank. No one but a crazy lobster would look there!
",69,4,15
"14695","Farnsworth 1: [on radio] It's gone!
",69,4,15
"14696","Zoidberg A: All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box! [He kisses Zoidberg 1's feet.] Now it's my turn, maybe?
",69,4,15
"14697","Zoidberg 1: The box says no.
",69,4,15
"14698","Narrator: [voice-over] Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun ... A.
",69,4,15
"14699","Hermes: Item one: Box. Check! Item two: Sun. [He looks at the sun and shields his eyes.] That's a big check.

",69,4,15
"14704","Amy A: Is it a kind of hairspray?
",69,4,15
"14705","Farnsworth A: No! We must attempt to make another box containing our universe. Doy!

"14706","Fry 1: Well? Is that your universe in there?
",69,4,15
"14707","Fry A: [from box] Nope. Too cold.
",69,4,15
"14708","Farnsworth A: [from box] Hmm! All women! [He comes out of the box covered in lipstick marks.] I'll put this one aside for later.
",69,4,15
"14709","Hermes 1: Oh, man, it's hopeless! We'll never find your universe in time. Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head.

"14710","Farnsworth 1: Yes, it's the apocalypse alright. I always thought I'd have a hand in it.
",69,4,15
"14711","Bender 1: I'm not sad because I finally found someone as great as me. It's like I always say, ""Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver--""

",70,4,16
"14941","Farnsworth: Oh, my, yes.

"14942","Bender: Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson.

"14948","Farnsworth: Oh, Lord! Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks.
",71,4,17
"14949","Fry: Shh! What was that sound?
",71,4,17
"14950","Bender: It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this. [He shakes a branch and a nest falls off it and breaks when it hits the ground. The two birds in it fly away, twittering.] Aww, they're so cute when they're scared.
",71,4,17
"14951","Fry: I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week, a blind hiker felt him.
",71,4,17
"14952","Farnsworth: Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot, you blathering ninny-hammer.
",71,4,17
"14953","Fry: Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with.
",71,4,17
"14954","Zoidberg: Why?
",71,4,17
"14955","Fry: 'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
",71,4,17
"14956","Zoidberg: [sadly] I can so relate to that.
",71,4,17
"14957","Leela: Ugh! Enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp, for God's sake. [quietly] Although you wouldn't know it from looking.
",71,4,17
"14958","Zoidberg: Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little ""just friends"" spooning.

"14960","Ranger Park: Hey, I'm Ranger Park, the park ranger.
",71,4,17
"14961","Fry: I get it!
",71,4,17
"14962","Ranger Park: Now since this area's a national Bigfoot preserve, we'll start with a short film about Bigfoot while I make a few phone calls.
",71,4,17
"14963","Narrator: [voice-over; in movie] Bigfoot ... [A hand stamps some words over the caption.] ... Endangered Mystery! [The movie shows a map of North America.] In the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest ... [The scene changes to the Patterson-Gimlin film.] ... dwells the strange and beautiful creature known as Bigfoot, perhaps.
",71,4,17
"14964","Fry: That proves it!
",71,4,17
"14965","Narrator: [voice-over; in movie] Sadly, logging and human settlement today threaten what might possibly be his habitat. Although if it's not, they don't. Bigfoot populations require vast amounts of land to remain elusive in. [The scene changes to some rocks.] They typically dwell just behind rocks but are also sometimes playful, bounding into thick fogs and out-of-focus areas.
",71,4,17
"14966","Ranger Park: It should say ""Top Quality Exercycle For Sale"" and could you put ""top quality"" in bold? You can't? OK, whatever.
",71,4,17
"14967","Narrator: [voice-over; in movie] Remember, it's up to us. Bigfoot is a crucial part of the ecosystem, if he exists. So let's all help keep Bigfoot possibly alive for future generations to enjoy unless he doesn't exist. The end.
",71,4,17
"14968","Ranger Park: I-I gotta call you back. [He hangs up.] Alright, questions?
",71,4,17
"14969","Sal: Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?
",71,4,17
"14970","Ranger Park: Technically, no. But I do see him each night in my dreams and each day in the smiling faces of hairy children.
",71,4,17
"14971","Farnsworth: [shouting] Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!
",71,4,17
"14972","Ranger Park: [holding up a bag] I have the droppings of someone who saw Bigfoot.
",71,4,17
"14973","Farnsworth: Shut up!
",71,4,17
"14974","Bender: Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!
",71,4,17
"14975","Ranger Park: Where?
",71,4,17
"14976","Bender: Eh, he's gone. He said you should keep wasting your life though.
",71,4,17
"14977","Petunia: Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the county fair.
",71,4,17
"14978","Ranger Park: What you saw was Bigfoot the monster truck. But thanks for a great question.
",71,4,17
"14979","Fry: Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?
",71,4,17
"14980","Ranger Park: Ah, that would be very expensive, and most people who believe in Bigfoot are broke.
",71,4,17
"14981","Bender: Hey, look! Bigfoot! He's back!
",71,4,17
"14982","Ranger Park: Where?
",71,4,17
"14983","Bender: Up your face! [He laughs.] Everybody do the Bender!

"14988","Fry: You doin' alright out there, buddy?
",71,4,17
"14989","Bender: Better than these gnats! [He zaps a few more and laughs.] That guy won't be goin' home to his kids.
",71,4,17
"14990","Bender: Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh, God, I wish I was safe inside a tent. [He hides behind a rock.] [deep voice] Fry! Fry wake up! It's me, Bigface!

"14991","Bender: [from outside] Come out and groom my mangy fur!
",71,4,17

",71,4,17
"14993","Fry: Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
",71,4,17
"14994","Fry: Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others, Bigfoot; I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health while you go... [He ""coos"".] But in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. [He walks into a clearing and looks around. Birds fly out from trees and the ground begins to shake. A strong wind blows leaves and things past Fry and a darkened flying saucer appears from over the trees. It lights up and beam of light engulfs Fry. He looks up and unshields his eyes.] Oh. Just a flying saucer. [shouting] Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there. [A tube extends from the spacecraft and zigzags around à la the Windows 3D Pipes screensaver.] Wow! Nice tube. [It sucks him up.] Hey! Hey, what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?

"14995","Leela: There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of this bold Canadian beer.

",71,4,17
"15000","Fry: Amy, you won't believe what happened ... [She looks up.] ... it was so scary that you wouldn't-- [She screams and runs.] I know, but listen, it gets even scarier.

"15001","Farnsworth: Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
",71,4,17
"15002","Fry: That's what I'm trying to tell you. See-- [The staff gather around.] Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?

"15007","Zoidberg: Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently. [He shakes him.] [shouting] Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!
",71,4,17
"15008","Fry: What?
",71,4,17
"15009","Bender: Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!

",71,4,17

",71,4,17
"15012","Fry: In the woods. I was walking ... for Bigfoot, looking ... and then aliens beamed me up.
",71,4,17

"15017","Fry: I'll never have another moment of happiness.
",71,4,17
"15018","Leela: I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour, but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose.
",71,4,17
"15019","Fry: [taking off the glasses] Eh, it wouldn't be the same. I want my nose. I don't want to have to teach a new one how to shoot milk when I laugh.
",71,4,17
"15020","Farnsworth: Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord, you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why.
",71,4,17
"15021","Bender: [gasping] Guys! Guys! There's something on television.
",71,4,17
"15022","Linda: [on TV] Alien abductions: Until now, a harmless nuisance. But recently they've taken on a sinister dimension as unsuspecting victims are returned ... without noses.
",71,4,17
"15023","Fry: Like me!

"15024","Morbo: [on TV] The culprits: Shameless poachers, hunting humans without a permit.
",71,4,17
"15025","Linda: [on TV] The valuable nose, or ""human horn"", fetches a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac.
",71,4,17
"15026","Fry: My nose is an aphrodisiac? [He retches.] I'm gonna drop a barf!
",71,4,17
"15027","Morbo: [on TV] Demand for human horn is great, due, in part, to titillating scenes from depraved alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth broadcast. Let's watch.
",71,4,17
"15028","Neptunian Woman: [on TV] Human horn? But ... it is forbidden!

"15037","Salesman: Welcome, friends. How may I pervert you?

",71,4,17
"15039","Salesman: [whispering] Shh! You're not cops, right?
",71,4,17
"15040","Leela: Of course not. In fact, he's a crook.

"15042","Salesman: Right this way.
",71,4,17
"15043","Salesman: Human horn. So fresh you can still see the eyeglass marks.
",71,4,17
"15044","Fry: Nope. Uh-uh. Ew! [He pulls out a photo of him and Slurms MacKenzie and points at his nose on the photo.] Now look. This is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?
",71,4,17
"15045","Salesman: I'm sorry, sir, but due to the perverted nature of our business, customer records are strictly confidential. [Leela punches him.] Right this way.

"15047","Leela: That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.

"15052","Lrrr: [on TV] Oh, no, no. I'm just some guy ... ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8!
",71,4,17
"15053","Lrrr: So let me get this straight: If I buy eight Caramello bars, you all get to go to some camp.
",71,4,17
"15054","Bender: Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
",71,4,17
"15055","Fry: Oh, great space king, I humbly beg you to return my human horn.
",71,4,17
"15056","Lrrr: Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why would a virile male like Lrrr need human horn? I don't even know what it's for. What is it, something you-you put in salad dressing?

"15059","Leela: Whoa! You guys have issues.
",71,4,17
"15060","Lrrr: She has issues! I'm fine! But there's no human horn around here, so make friends with the door.
",71,4,17
"15061","Fry: [sadly] Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
",71,4,17
"15062","Nd-Nd: Oh, let's just give it to him. [She picks up a box.] Here.

"15064","Lrrr: Uh, what is that? How do you have that, Nd-Nd? [He pulls his cape string like a collar.] I've never seen it before. My friend left it here.
",71,4,17

",71,4,17
"15069","Lrrr: At least someone noticed.
",71,4,17
"15070","Nd-Nd: For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your first wife was the one who liked lilacs.
",71,4,17

"15072","Fry: Well, great seeing you. I guess we'll be on our--
",71,4,17
"15073","Bender: Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?
",71,4,17
"15074","Lrrr: But, uh, I thought the horn was the human wing-dang-doodle.
",71,4,17
"15075","Bender: No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!
",71,4,17
"15076","Lrrr: Interesting. The trousers conceal a tiny secondary horn.

"15077","Fry: Hey, what've you heard?
",71,4,17
"15078","Lrrr: [shouting] Guards! Seize him! [They do. Fry screams.] Prepare to harvest the lower horn!
",71,4,17
"15079","Fry: OK, you can have my nose.

",71,4,17
"15081","Guard #1: Yeah?
",71,4,17
"15082","Lrrr: Remove the human's lower horn and prepare it to be eaten by me.
",71,4,17
"15083","Nd-Nd: In other words, slop a lot of ketchup and salt on it.
",71,4,17

"15089","Bender: [shouting] That's what she said!
",71,4,17
"15090","Leela: Let's face it, you two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac.

"15091","Fry: However huge it might be.
",71,4,17
"15092","Nd-Nd: So what do you suggest, painfully-single human?
",71,4,17
"15093","Leela: Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?
",71,4,17
"15094","Nd-Nd: Oh, I don't know. Lrrr used to be so tender.
",71,4,17
"15095","Lrrr: I only wrote that poem to test my printer.
",71,4,17
"15096","Nd-Nd: We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr would find injured little tinkle-bunnies and nurse them back to health.

",71,4,17
"15100","Fry: Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
",71,4,17
"15101","Leela: Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars.
",71,4,17
"15102","Nd-Nd: Hmm. Sounds interesting. But he would never do it.

"15103","Lrrr: Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna be blamed for not going.

",71,4,17
"15112","Fry: I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!

"15114","Nd-Nd: Why don't you just inject some fat straight into your ass and cut out the middle man?
",71,4,17
"15115","Lrrr: One of these days, Nd-Nd. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the third moon of Omicron Persei 8!
",71,4,17

"15118","Fry: So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?
",71,4,17
"15119","Nd-Nd: Poorly.
",71,4,17
"15120","Lrrr: My wife is right, for once. There's very little magic in the air. Ready the lower horn transport vessel.

"15132","Nd-Nd: Look at his adorable little feet. [Bigfoot bangs his chest, growls and throws leaves into the air. Lrrr chuckles.] Yes, you are a cutie-pie.
",71,4,17
"15133","Ranger Park: Holy macaroni! [He takes some photos.] I can't believe I'm seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh, I've waited my entire life for this moment.
",71,4,17
"15134","Nd-Nd: What?
",71,4,17
"15135","Bender: What are you doing with that?
",71,4,17
"15136","Lrrr: You're going to kill this innocent giganto?
",71,4,17
"15137","Ranger Park: Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilize him so I can chop off his feet as proof he exists. Then dump him back in the wild. He'll do fine.
",71,4,17
"15138","Lrrr: You'll have to get through me first.
",71,4,17
"15139","Ranger Park: OK. Nighty night!
",71,4,17
"15140","Lrrr: Now leave this gentle Sasquatch, or Wood Ape, in peace so I can finally and at long last harvest this pathetic human's lower horn.
",71,4,17
"15141","Fry: Yeah!
",71,4,17
"15142","Lrrr: Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this beast's lower horn, am I any better than that ranger with his demented foot lust? Yes. But not by enough.
",71,4,17
"15143","Ranger Park: Score!
",71,4,17
"15144","Lrrr: This human's lower horn is one of God's creatures, a living thing, and all living things, large and small--
",71,4,17
"15145","Bender: [shouting] In this case ""small""!
",71,4,17
"15146","Lrrr: Have dignity and a spark of the divine.
",71,4,17
"15147","Nd-Nd: That's the gentle, sensitive, poet warlord I fell in love with.
",71,4,17
"15148","Lrrr: [shouting] Uh, you'll wanna retreat to a safe, 500-metre radius!
",71,4,17
"15149","Leela: Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn.
",71,4,17
"15150","Bender: As usual! [He hoots.] [shouting] Run away!
",71,4,17
"15151","Narrator: [voice-over; on TV] You're on a scenic route through a state recreation known as the human mind. You ask a passer-by for directions, only to find he has no face or something. Suddenly, up ahead, a door in the road. You swerve, narrowly avoiding The Scary Door.

"15152","Scientist: [on TV] I have combined the DNA of the world's most evil animals to make the most evil creature of them all.
",71,4,17
"15153","Man: [on TV] It turns out it's Man.
",71,4,17
"15154","Bender: Huh? [He scratches his ass and looks at some signs on Fry's bedroom door. ""No Trespassing"", ""Keep Out"", ""Private"", ""Keep Out Bender"" and a picture of Bender with a cross through it.] I choose to not understand these signs.
",72,4,18
"15155","Bender: Aha!
",72,4,18
"15156","Fry: Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor.
",72,4,18
"15157","Bender: Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it.
",72,4,18
"15158","Fry: I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
",72,4,18
"15159","Bender: Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?
",72,4,18
"15160","Fry: I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me. [He picks up a photo of Leela and him riding on the back of an angry looking Zoidberg.] Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?
",72,4,18
"15161","Bender: Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though.
",72,4,18
"15162","Bender: Whoa! Hey!
",72,4,18
"15163","Fry: Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger.
",72,4,18
"15164","Mrs. Mellonger: Hello, Philip. [She looks at Bender.] And you must be Mr. Bender. Philip's told me so much about you. Is it true that you're a robot?
",72,4,18
"15165","Bender: I prefer the term ""love machine"".
",72,4,18
"15166","Bender: Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
",72,4,18
"15167","Mother: Fairly hard.
",72,4,18
"15168","Fry: The Grumpy Snail. [He plays the holophonor. An image of a grumpy snail slowly crawling along a branch forms. He plays a bad note and the snail turns around and glares at him angrily.] Sorry!
",72,4,18
"15169","Boy: [crying] It's too grumpy!
",72,4,18
"15170","Fry: Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!
",72,4,18
"15171","Mrs. Mellonger: Mr. Bender, I simply cannot teach your child.
",72,4,18
"15172","Bender: Then good day, madam! [He pushes Fry through the door and closes it behind him. He opens it again and pokes his head back into the room.] We hope to see you soon for tea.
",72,4,18
"15173","Fry: It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
",72,4,18
"15174","Bender: Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
",72,4,18
"15175","Leela: Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?
",72,4,18
"15176","Fry: At, uh, uh, a concert.
",72,4,18
"15177","Leela: Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
",72,4,18
"15178","Bender: So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?
",72,4,18
"15179","Leela: Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--
",72,4,18
"15180","Fry: [quietly] Pretty boy.
",72,4,18
"15181","Leela: But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt. [muttering] I couldn't believe it. I was really...
",72,4,18
"15182","Fry: That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
",72,4,18
"15183","Bender: Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil"". And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil"". And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat"".
",72,4,18
"15184","Robot Devil: You hit a sour note about 200 years back, Doug! [Doug, the Hellbot with the saxophone, hangs his head in shame.] Let's take it from the top. [Enter Bender and Fry on the slide. They land at the Robot Devil's feet.] Ah, Bender, Fry. You've come back for more eternal damnation.
",72,4,18
"15185","Bender: No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons.
",72,4,18
"15186","Fry: Yep. I need to get really good without practising.
",72,4,18
"15187","Robot Devil: Hell is full of ten-year-olds who wanted exactly the same thing. Trouble is, you have what my old music teacher, Mrs. Mellonger, calls ""stupid fingers"". [He twiddles his own fingers then slaps them.] With hands like that you'll be lucky to master a belt buckle. [Fry looks down and sees his trousers have fallen around his ankles. He quickly pulls them up.] Now wouldn't it be nice if you had a pair of robot hands to replace them?
",72,4,18
"15188","Fry: Sure would. [He shrugs.] Oh, well. Goodbye.
",72,4,18
"15189","Bender: Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you.
",72,4,18
"15190","Fry: He-He-He is? [He turns around.] Great! Wait, what's the catch?
",72,4,18
"15191","Robot Devil: No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at random from somewhere in the universe, probably one you've never even met, and then I'll remove his hands and switch them for yours. [Bender rubs his hands with glee.] It's just the sort of guy I am. What do you say?
",72,4,18
"15192","Fry: I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
",72,4,18
"15193","Bender: Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you.
",72,4,18
"15194","Fry: Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?
",72,4,18
"15195","Robot Devil: Definitely probably not. [A column of rock rises up out of the ground with a piece of paper on top.] Just sign this contract.
",72,4,18
"15196","Bender: Wow!
",72,4,18
"15197","Robot Devil: And here we go!
",72,4,18
"15198","Bender: I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
",72,4,18
"15199","Fry: Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
",72,4,18
"15200","Robot Devil: Oh, what an appallingly ironic outcome.
",72,4,18
"15201","Bender: It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!
",72,4,18
"15202","Robot Devil: Y'know, I only put my name on there as a show of good faith for the other robots.
",72,4,18
"15203","Fry: Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
",72,4,18
"15204","Robot Devil: Oh, very well.
",72,4,18
"15205","Fry: [impressed] How'd you do that?
",72,4,18
"15206","Robot Devil: They're very good hands.
",72,4,18
"15207","Fry: At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
",72,4,18
"15208","Robot Devil: Oh, sorry. That'll wear off in a couple of days.
",72,4,18
"15209","Fry: Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands.
",72,4,18
"15210","Amy: Neat! Let's see a trick.
",72,4,18
"15211","Fry: Alrighty!
",72,4,18
"15212","Scruffy: Somebody called the Robot Devil's here to see somebody called Fry.
",72,4,18
"15213","Fry: Uh-oh.
",72,4,18
"15214","Bender: Where'd I go just now?
",72,4,18
"15215","Robot Devil: Hello, Fry. [He cackles.] Just dropped by to make sure you're as happy with our little deal as I am. [He cracks and grabs Fry by his jacket.] Give me back my hands! These things are always touching me in places.
",72,4,18
"15216","Fry: Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal.
",72,4,18
"15217","Robot Devil: Looks like I wasted a bus trip.
",72,4,18
"15218","Fry: Yes, you did.
",72,4,18
"15219","Grumpy Snail: [on TV] Yes. Now you can hear holophonor virtuoso Philip Fry play 900 of these classic themes in your own home on this two-record set. [Behind him Fry walks along a sunset-lit beach playing his holophonor. The hologram flies to the front of the screen revealing it to be his album. The cover features him lying naked on a bed holding the holophonor.] That's over 30 minutes of music for only $14.99.
",72,4,18
"15220","Zoidberg: Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!

",72,4,18
"15222","Zoidberg: Hello? I'll take eight!
",72,4,18
"15223","Scruffy: Mr. Hedonismbot to see you.
",72,4,18
"15224","Fry: Uh, show him in.
",72,4,18
"15225","Scruffy: [bowing] Very good, sir.
",72,4,18
"15226","Hedonismbot: Ah, Fry. Congratulations. Your latest performance was as delectable as dipping my bottom over and over into a bath of the silkiest oils and creams.
",72,4,18
"15227","Fry: Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for.
",72,4,18
"15228","Hedonismbot: You were the sole diversion in what has been a pale and unamusing season. And so I would fain commission you write an opera.
",72,4,18
"15229","Fry: But I've never written an opera.
",72,4,18
"15230","Hedonismbot: And I've never heard one. Still, if you can keep me amused through the overture I shall consider it a smashing success.
",72,4,18
"15231","Fry: But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless... [He turns and looks at Leela, who sits at the table gorging on a buggalo leg dripping with barbecue sauce. He smiles and turns to Hedonismbot.] OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela.
",72,4,18
"15232","Leela: Me? Really?
",72,4,18
"15233","Hedonismbot: A man writing an opera about a woman? [He laughs.] Oh, sirrah, how deliciously absurd! [He turns around to the door.] I shall see you at the premiere.
",72,4,18
"15234","Leela: Is it part of the opera?
",72,4,18
"15235","Fry: Leela! [He stands up.] You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
",72,4,18
"15236","Leela: But it's so beautiful.
",72,4,18
"15237","Fry: So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
",72,4,18
"15238","Leela: Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool. [She looks into his eyes and holds his hands then quickly takes hers away.] They're so cold.
",72,4,18
"15239","Robot Devil: [shouting; from street] And yet hell is so hot! [He laughs briefly.] Can I have my hands back now?
",72,4,18
"15240","Fry: [shouting] No!
",72,4,18
"15241","Robot Devil: [shouting; from street] You're not nice!
",72,4,18
"15242","Robot Devil: Ah, Bender, this is a surprise! For you! Finding me in the refrigerator.
",72,4,18
"15243","Bender: True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?
",72,4,18
"15244","Robot Devil: Oh, well it so happens I'm in the mood to make a deal with you.
",72,4,18
"15245","Bender: Forget it! You can't tempt me.
",72,4,18
"15246","Robot Devil: [tempting] Really? There's nothing you want?
",72,4,18
"15247","Bender: Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want. [He scratches his chin and leans against the worktop.] Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying.
",72,4,18
"15248","Robot Devil: Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return is your hands. [He looks at Fry's hands.] To replace these bony hotdogs!
",72,4,18
"15249","Bender: Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
",72,4,18
"15250","Robot Devil: Well is there anything else you would part with?
",72,4,18
"15251","Bender: No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.
",72,4,18
"15252","Bender: Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.
",72,4,18
"15253","Robot Devil: You certainly are a shrewd businessman, Bender. [While Bender isn't looking he tosses the crotch-plate into the bin.] Now find someone and give 'em a good blast!
",72,4,18
"15254","Bender: Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.
",72,4,18
"15255","Robot Devil: Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan is one-quarter complete!
",72,4,18
"15256","Leela: Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms.
",72,4,18
"15257","Bender: Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?
",72,4,18
"15258","Leela: [shouting] What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!
",72,4,18
"15259","Bender: Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you.
",72,4,18
"15260","Leela: [shouting] What? Oh, this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.
",72,4,18
"15261","Robot Devil: Ah, how delightfully ironic.
",72,4,18
"15262","Bender: It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!
",72,4,18
"15263","Robot Devil: Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!
",72,4,18
"15264","Bender: Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal-- [He points at where his crotch-plate used to be. No ass left to bite.] [shouting] Oh, nooo!
",72,4,18
"15265","Leela: Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart.
",72,4,18
"15266","Bender: OK, deaf-o!
",72,4,18
"15267","Hedonismbot: Courtesans and gentle fops, I bid you welcome to my opera. Let us cavort like the Greeks of old. [sexfully] You know the ones I mean.
",72,4,18
"15268","Leela: Yay, Fry!
",72,4,18

",72,4,18
"15282","Leela: What? You can give me new ears? Wait. What seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?
",72,4,18
"15283","Robot Devil: Just your hands, my dear.
",72,4,18
"15284","Leela: Whatever you said, forget it!
",72,4,18

"18696","Fry (sighing): Why does everything I date run away?  I love Leela, always and forever.  And if I loved Robot Leela, too...
",89,6,1
"18697","Fry (cont'd): ...well, that's only 'cause she had so much of real Leela in her.  I thought she loved me, too, but, obviously, I was wrong as usual.

",89,6,1
"18709","Robot Leela: Yeah, you idiot!
",89,6,1
"18710","Fry: Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone. [accidentally drops the gun which shoots at his chest area] Whoa! Right between the lungs. Man, that was close. [screams]

",89,6,1
"18712","Zoidberg: [picking up an x-ray of Robot Fry] Aha!  That explains this growth on your drive shaft.

"18713","Robot Fry: But how is this possible?
",89,6,1
"18714","Farnsworth: Who knows?  Oh, I do.  Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed.
",89,6,1
"18715","Fry: I'll protect you, Leela!  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!
",89,6,1
"18716","Farnsworth (v.o.): Fry did in fact save Leela, though at a terrible cost to himself.  I tossed him into the stem cells but he just bubbled away like phlegm on a hot sidewalk.[As the remains of Fry bubble away, the camera pans up to reveal Leela running out crying all the way to Build-a-Bot Workshop.]
<poem>Farnsworth (v.o.): Leela was so upset, she went all Blade Runner and built a duplicate...

"18717","Farnsworth (v.o): ...then uploaded his personality from the urinal surveillance tapes.
",89,6,1
"18718","Fry: [from the tape of him at the urinal] I sure love Leela.

"18719","Farnsworth (v.o.): Alas, in recreating Fry's adorable jelly belly, she had overstuffed him with copper wadding.
",89,6,1
"18720","Farnsworth (v.o.): The inevitable static discharged electrocuted Leela and destroyed both of their short-term memories.
",89,6,1
"18721","Robot Fry: So that's why I'm so amazed by these things I already knew.
",89,6,1
"18722","Farnsworth (v.o.): What could I do?  I hung up Leela with the other bone bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew.

",89,6,1
"18738","Fry: Uh, this is a bit awkward.  Or is it?
",89,6,1
"18739","Leela: I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.

",90,6,2
"18841","Zapp: Me, too. We better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel.
",90,6,2
"18842","Leela: Uh, I suppose so.

"18858","Farnsworth: This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998.

"18859","Farnsworth (cont'd): And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs.
",90,6,2
"18860","Bender: Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?

",90,6,2
"18873","Leela: So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?

"18875","Leela: Thank you.  [takes them and eats them]

Let the contest begin![Montage: We see a ""Twit Meter"" with two thermometers and follower counters, one for Bender, who currently has 50,000 followers, and one for Fry, who currently has only 37.  We see a video being recorded of Farnsworth doing an experiment with Diet Solarmanite and Mentos.  He drops all the Mentos in the drink, it explodes.  Literally.  He ends up setting himself on fire.  It is revealed that Bender was the one recording that.  As a result, his Twit Meter goes up to 200,000 followers.  Next, we see Fry recording a video in front of a whiteboard with ""My Politicle Views: Part 56 Tariffs"" on it. We don't hear what he's saying.  As a result, his Twit Meter goes down to 19 followers.  Next we see Amy in front of the same whiteboard wearing a bikini and pumps.  Again, we see that Bender is recording that video.  His Twit Meter goes up to 800,000 followers.][Scene: Interior shot of Mom's office.  Mom is watching the Twit Meters on her computer.]

He left my legs visible in the painting as a clue, then dispatched me hither to wait for his shadow society of intellectuals.
",93,6,5
"19469","Fry: Hi, Animatronio.
",93,6,5
"19470","Farnsworth: You personally knew da Vinci? [He gives a fan-girlish squeal.] Was he nice? How did his hair smell? And on a personal note, what is the function of this device? [He shows the plans.]
",93,6,5
"19471","Animatronio: Halt! You do not know the function of the Macchina Magnifica? Then thou art not members of the Shadow Society. [He takes the plans.]
",93,6,5
"19472","Bender: The what now?
",93,6,5
"19473","Animatronio: Not one more word shall I breathe. Not even about the great fountain where thou mayest find the... Wait. Thou didst not know about the fountain, didst thou? Curses, I must be punished. [He begins flaying himself.]
",93,6,5
"19474","Farnswoth: Quick, we must find out what he knows before he flays himself to death!
",93,6,5
"19475","Leela: Where is the great fountain?
",93,6,5
"19476","Fry: What makes it so great?
",93,6,5
"19477","Bender: Why does a robot need a codpiece?
",93,6,5
"19478","Animatronio: Fie, thou fen-suckled bum-bailey! Thou wilst never pry information from these mechanical lips!
",93,6,5
"19479","Leela: Just tell us, already!
",93,6,5
"19480","Animatronio: Okay, the fountain thou seekest is... [He groans and falls over.]
",93,6,5
"19481","Farnsworth: And so dies our hope of solving this mystery. Come on gang, let's go home. Wait! Let's not give up so easily. Animatronio mentioned a fountain. [He looks at a statue.] That's a statue of Neptune, god of water. The number of points on him trident is three, or trey. The ""u"" in his name is written like ""v"". Trey, ""v"". Trevi! It's the Trevi Fountain. There can be no question!
",93,6,5
"19482","Leela: But, Professor...
",93,6,5
"19483","Farnsworth: There can be no question!
",93,6,5
"19484","Fry: Wow, it hasn't changed in a thousand years. [Tentacles reach out of the water and grab a man posing for a picture.]
",93,6,5
"19485","Farnsworth: Okay, everyone, into the fountain.
",93,6,5
"19486","Bender: What are you, senile? I'm not jumping in there.
",93,6,5
"19487","Fry: Hey, look. Coins.
",93,6,5
"19488","Bender: [He jumps into the fountain. Before he can grab the change, a Giant Squid comes out of a cave. The squid and Bender struggle then both pull out pistols. Gunshots can be heard from the surface. The dead Squid floats up.] I got 48 cents. There's one more nickel, and it's a big one! [He floats down and pulls at the nickel. It is actually a plug keeping water in the fountain. The water starts to drain, taking Bender with it.]
",93,6,5
"19489","Farnsworth: Quickly, into the sewer hole. [He and Fry jump in.]
",93,6,5
"19490","Leela: Why? [She is pulled under by the Professor. A hooded figure selling Gelato notices and follows them.]
",93,6,5
"19491","Fry: [Looking through a window.] What's this dump? [They are surrounded by Roman Architecture.]
",93,6,5
"19492","Farnsworth: My god! It's the Pantheon!
",93,6,5
"19493","Leela: This place is 3,000 years old. What could possibly be left to discover?
",93,6,5
"19494","Farnsworth: Maybe something about ourselves, Leela. Wait! What's under that blanket? [Fry removes it to reveal a statue of the Vitruvian Man.] My God! da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!
",93,6,5
"19495","Fry: It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong.
",93,6,5
"19496","Farnsworth: [The hooded figure appears and shoots a dart at the Professor.] Say, what's this? [He moves in time for the dart to miss him and hit Bender's eye.]
",93,6,5
"19497","Bender: Anyone hear something?
",93,6,5
"19498","Farnsworth: It's a coin slot. Bender, insert that giant nickel.
",93,6,5
"19499","Bender: Sure. [He has the nickel on a piece of string. He inserts it and it takes his entire arm with it.] Ow!
",93,6,5
"19500","Farnswoth: Hush, Bender. [The statue realigns itself.] What's your game, Vitruvian Man? [The statue turns on it side and rolls along the floor. The floor divides behind the statue. Leela scrambles to get to the Professor. A workshop is revealed under the floor.] I withdraw the question, Vitruvian Man.
",93,6,5
"19501","Farnsworth: Da Vinci's lost workshop!
",93,6,5
"19502","Fry: At the risk of sounding stupid, do these things actually work?
",93,6,5
"19503","Farnsworth: Of course not, stupid! [He gestures to a flying machine] I mean, that flying machine is as aerodynamic as a sofa. How could it possibly get off the ground?
",93,6,5
"19504","Animatronio: In a way that shalt never discover. [Everyone but Fry gasps].
",93,6,5
"19505","Fry: Hi, Animatronio.
",93,6,5
"19506","Animatronio: I feign death and stalk thee, that I might preserve the greatest of Leonardo's secrets! [He throws a mace and it lands on Bender's empty arm socket. Bender hits him with the handle of the mace.]
",93,6,5
"19507","Bender: All right, buddy, we want secrets! And they better be ancient!
",93,6,5
"19508","Animatronio: Porco metallico! Never shall I reveal how these wonderous machines fit together!
",93,6,5
"19509","Farnsworth: They fit together?
",93,6,5
"19510","Animatronio: I said no such thing. And then I died! [He groans and collapses. He opens his eye then shuts it again.]
",93,6,5
"19511","Fry: [Sitting in the chair of the flying machine] You're right, Professor. This thing doesn't fly.
",93,6,5
"19512","Farnsworth: Don't sit in there, you idiot! That's dangerous! [He sits on a catapult and gets shot into a series of tubes that directs him into the co-pilot's seat.] Wha? [The machine is lifted up and glass is placed on top of their heads, creating a sealed cockpit. Several more machines go off and the ship is loaded into a cannon.] No wonder this contraction isn't aerodynamic! It's not an aircraft, it's a spacecraft! [The cannon is pointed to a gap in the ceiling.]
",93,6,5
"19513","Animatronio: Basta! As I live, thou shan't discover the great secret! [He works a ballista until it is pointed at the spacecraft. Bender and Leela tackle him. The ballista falls and fires at a lever. The spacecraft is shot into the air.]
",93,6,5
"19514","Fry: Bye, Animatronio!
",93,6,5
"19515","Farnsworth: My God! Why would Leonardo's machine's brought us here?
",93,6,5
"19516","Fry: I don't know. Let's ask this guy. [A man is standing in front of them.]
",93,6,5
"19517","Leonardo da Vinci: I am Leonardo. [They gasp.] Welcome to Planet Vinci.
",93,6,5
"19518","Farnsworth: My God!
",93,6,5
"19519","Fry: That's what I was gonna say!
",93,6,5
"19520","Farnsworth: Leonardo! You're alive? Here?
",93,6,5
"19521","Leonardo: [He sighs.] You have learned my great secret. I was but a visitor to Earth. In truth, I am what you call a space alien.
",93,6,5
"19522","Farnsworth: Oh!
",93,6,5
"19523","Fry: It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo. And may I say you were great in Titanic. The Beach? Neh.
",93,6,5
"19524","Farnsworth: That's Leonardo DiCaprio, you blockhead! [He tries to punch Fry in the stomach. Bones are heard cracking.]
",93,6,5
"19525","Fry: Looks like eating rocks wasn't as dumb as you said.
",93,6,5
"19526","Fry: So what do people do for fun here?
",93,6,5
"19527","Leonardo: Do you enjoy partying all night with plenty of ale and lusty women?
",93,6,5
"19528","Fry: I sure do!
",93,6,5
"19529","Leonardo: Not us. We spend our leisure time in the mathematics museum. Planet Vinci is basically a single colossal university.
",93,6,5
"19530","Fry: How your football team?
",93,6,5
"19531","Leonardo: Learned.
",93,6,5
"19532","Farnsworth: Ooh! I'm going to check out that math lecture. [A professor is teaching students nearby.] All this knowledge is giving me a raging brainer! [He runs off.]
",93,6,5
"19533","Leonardo: Would you like to hear the lecture, too, Fry?
",93,6,5
"19534","Fry: No. It would just go in one ear and out some other hole.
",93,6,5
"19535","Leonardo: Come, sit down.
",93,6,5
"19536","Fry: Now that I can do. [He tries to sit in mid-air but fails.] I have a terrible secret to confess, Mr. DiCaprio. I'm not very smart.
",93,6,5
"19537","Leonardo: I appreciate your candor.
",93,6,5
"19538","Fry: I don't even know what language you're speaking.
",93,6,5
"19539","Leonardo: I, too, have a confession. You see, here on Planet Vinci, I am the stupidest person.
",93,6,5
"19540","Fry: What? Who possibly think you're stupid? [Two people come near the bench.]
",93,6,5
"19541","Biff: Duh, I'm Leonardo. I don't know the mass of the Higgs boson.
",93,6,5
"19542","Woman: Duh, I have to draw in pencil, because I don't know how to use Rendering software.
",93,6,5
"19543","Leonardo: Stupid Biff. Thinks he's so smart.
",93,6,5
"19544","Fry: He looks stronger than you, too.
",93,6,5
"19545","Leonardo: I went to Earth because I could no longer stand the ridicule. But being surrounded by even stupider people was equally infuriating.
",93,6,5
"19546","Fry: I can see myself in your shiny button.
",93,6,5
"19547","Leonardo: Inventing is what makes me happy. Or did, until I misplaced the plans for my masterpiece.
",93,6,5
"19548","Fry: You mean these? [He holds out the plans.]
",93,6,5
"19549","Leonardo: The Macchina Magnifica? Infinity joy! Fry, my friend, you have given my life a meaning again!
",93,6,5
"19550","Farnsworth: That calculus lecture was harder than I expected. We had to answer every question in the form of an opera. I have a lot of homework for tomorrow, if I don't want to be [He puts on a Viking opera helmet.] Embarrassed!
",93,6,5
"19551","Fry: [Fry finishes his ""musical piece"" and the crowd starts booing.] Thank you. Thank you. And if you like that, you'll love our main event. Ladies and gentlemen, Leonardo DiCaprio! [The crowd cheers.] I mean da Vinci! [The crowd starts booing again.]
",93,6,5
"19552","Leonardo: For centuries, you've all ridiculed me. Especially you, Biff.
",93,6,5
"19553","Biff: Nice hat! [The crowd hoots.]
",93,6,5
"19554","Leonardo: But, at long last, this invention will show you. It will show you all. Behold, my unstoppable doomsday machine!
",93,6,5
"19555","Fry: And I helped! Wait. You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine.
",93,6,5
"19556","Leonardo: Ice cream is just a by-product of the machine. It's primary purpose is to exterminate everyone who ever made me feel inferior!
",93,6,5
"19557","Biff: Oh, I'm so scared!
",93,6,5
"19558","Girl: Bring it on, dum-dum. [The crowd laughs.]
",93,6,5
"19559","Leonardo: Oh yeah? Let's see how hard you are laughing when my doomsday machine chops off your face! [He powers up the machine.]
",93,6,5
"19560","Farnsworth: Leonardo, stop! [The crowd gasps.] I want in on this!
",93,6,5
"19561","Fry: Are you crazy, Professor?
",93,6,5
"19562","Farnsworth: I hate these nerds. Just because I'm stupider than them, they think they're smarter than me. Kill them all, starting with the math teacher!
",93,6,5
"19563","Farnsworth: [Taking the plans from Fry.] I knew this final invention would be a humdinger!
",93,6,5
"19564","Leonardo: Yes, we three idiots will finally have our revenge.
",93,6,5
"19565","Fry: I don't think so! You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot. [He jumps on the machine.] There's always going to someone smarter than you, so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you've got.
",93,6,5
"19566","Leonardo: But you've got nothing.
",93,6,5
"19567","Fry:Oh no? I've got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with. And I'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all! [He tries to nail in a nail but it hits him in the eye. He stumbles and gets caught in the gears.  Fry is being sent through the gears of the machine, finally jamming it. The machine stops and falls over. Leonardo and the Professor run out of the way. The audience laughs.]
",93,6,5
"19568","Biff: Some doomsday machine! It barely killed anyone!
",93,6,5
"19569","Leonardo: Oh, yeah? Well, take this! [He kicks the machine, causing a lever to pop out. He pulls it and a giant gear crushes him.]
",93,6,5
"19570","Farnsworth: Oh, my.
",93,6,5
"19571","Girl: Poor Leonardo da Vinci. He sure was stupid.
",93,6,5
"19572","Farnsworth: Fry, I admire what you did today, and I'm deeply sorry for insulting your intellect. Your tiny, tiny intellect. Oops, there I go again, you dope. I mean, dummy.
",93,6,5
"19573","Fry: It's okay. I may not be clever, but I have a good heart. That's what my mom used to say.
",93,6,5
"19574","Farnsworth: She was a wise woman.
",93,6,5
"19575","Fry: Also, that I'm not much to look at.
",93,6,5
"19576","Farnsworth: A wise woman, indeed.

"19578","Fry: [standing in mud, surrounded by flies] This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War.

",94,6,6
"19596","Fry: It's payback time, Sploder! [Fry's gun fires a beam that tags Sploder then falls flat. Fry presses a button on his gun and the beam retracts.]

",94,6,6
"19598","Hermes: [Wheeling his desk up] That's three dead. Uh-oh. Let's pick up the pace, people. At this point in the actual war, the death toll was ninety-eight million. [He gestures towards a large set of graves nearby]

",94,6,6
"19602","Fry: If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard.

",94,6,6
"19605","Bender: Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!

",94,6,6
"19629","Farnsworth: Alas, no. Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's a symptom of a fatal defect.
",94,6,6
"19630","Bender: Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into a new, equally fabulous, body.
",94,6,6

"19664","Hermes: The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats. We should be able to look up Inspector 5.

",94,6,6
"19666","Hermes: Uh, he's my pencil sharpener.
",94,6,6
"19667","Bender: You betcha! [He takes the man's pencil and sharpens it in his ass then hands it back]
",94,6,6
"19668","Man: [While staring at the pencil] Proceed. [He picks up the pencil with tongs and drops it in a fire.]

"19669","Hermes: I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways.

"19670","Bender: Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting.
",94,6,6
"19671","Bender: I did like the part where they screamed.
",94,6,6
"19672","Hermes: [Wheeling an escalator to his cubicle.] This is mine. Right next to the center square.
",94,6,6
"19673","Center Square Guy: Sorry, Hermes. I drank all your white-out. [He laughs]
",94,6,6
"19674","Hermes: Once I log in, I can access Inspector 5's profile.
",94,6,6
"19675","Bender: [He sits in front of the computer and has his eye scanned. A buzzer sounds.] Damn it! It won't go on.
",94,6,6
"19676","Hermes: That's because you're not me. [He sits in front of the computer and begins working]
",94,6,6
"19677","Bender: Hooray! It won't go on!

"19678","Hermes: The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log in. [He is scanned and his profile appears onscreen.]

"19686","Hermes: The information we need will be here, in the physical files.
",94,6,6
"19687","Bender: [Rolling up his ""sleeves""] Those bastards won't know what leafed through them. [Hermes opens the door and they run inside, looking around. There is only one filing cabinet with three drawers] It's on!
",94,6,6
"19688","Hermes: [He opens the drawer and it knocks Bender down. Hermes looks through the files.] No! This is impossible! Quit blacking out and look at this. Inspectors 1, 2, 3, 4... 6. There's no trace of Inspector 5!
",94,6,6
"19689","Bender: But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3...

"19690","Hermes: Addition never solve anything, man. Let's cut our losses and go home.
",94,6,6
"19691","Bender: So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point. [He walks into a suicide booth]
",94,6,6
"19692","Hermes: Bender, no! Suicide isn't necessarily the answer!
",94,6,6
"19693","Bender: It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth. [He closes the door]
",94,6,6
"19694","Hermes: They have phones in booths now? Finally, I don't have to lug this cellphone around. [He throws his cellphone into a trash bin]

"19697","Bender: Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!
",94,6,6
"19698","Mom: A defective robot, you say? [A monitor shows Bender in the phone booth with Hermes nearby.] Stay right there, dearie. [Cross-hairs appear over the phone booth] I'll have tech support take care of you. [She presses a button]
",94,6,6
"19699","Bender: [He exits the phone booth.] Well, things are starting to look up.
",94,6,6
"19700","Hermes: Look up! [They dive out of the way of a missile that explodes nearby.] Who did you call? Dial-a-bomb?
",94,6,6
"19701","Bender: No, I just told the robot company I was defective.
",94,6,6
"19702","Hermes: You dumb cocktail shaker! Mom won't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name! She'll kill you.
",94,6,6
"19703","Bender: Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of which– [Machine guns start shooting at them] You're right. You're right. You're right. [They run away]

"19704","Mom: [Watching the Killbots on a monitor] That's what you get for calling tech support.
",94,6,6
"19705","Bender: I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip. [They skip off]

"19706","Hermes: Just a few more feet. We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7:38.
",94,6,6
"19707","Bender: A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?
",94,6,6
"19708","Hermes: It's the 7:38! Jump! [They both jump into a train car. The Killbots come up on the track next to it.]
",94,6,6
"19709","Bender: Aw, shoot!
",94,6,6
"19710","Killbot: Someone said ""shoot!"" [They shoot and destroy the Killbot in the middle.]
",94,6,6
"19711","Bender: Well, we're boned!
",94,6,6
"19712","Hermes: No, we're not! We just go to limbo!
",94,6,6

",94,6,6
"19714","Killbot 1: We're gonna get fired.
",94,6,6
"19715","Killbot 2: Someone said ""fire!"" [He shoots Killbot 1, then is killed by the tunnel.]
",94,6,6
"19716","Bender: [His legs have been broken] We did it!
",94,6,6
"19717","Hermes: Twelve straight hours of limbo. I haven't done that since my honeymoon.

",94,6,6
"19719","Hermes: I sure do.
",94,6,6
"19720","Bender: That was fun.
",94,6,6
"19721","Bender: Where are we?
",94,6,6
"19722","Hermes: I have no idea.
",94,6,6
"19723","Bender: Hey. We're just a stone's throw from Tijuana. [He picks up a stone and throws it over the border fence.] See?
",94,6,6
"19724","Mexican Man: ¡Dios mío! A rock has fallen here in the outskirts of Tijuana.
",94,6,6
"19725","Bender: Is it within city limits?
",94,6,6
"19726","Mexican Man: I think, yes.
",94,6,6
"19727","Bender: Told you!
",94,6,6
"19728","Hermes: Hey, you wanna celebrate our escape? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight?
",94,6,6
"19729","Bender: Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole.
",94,6,6
"19730","Bender: [Bender and Hermes walk up to a border checkpoint.] He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this.
",94,6,6
"19731","Mexican border patrolman: Sus papeles, por favor.
",94,6,6
"19732","Bender: ¡Sí! [Bender gets hit on the head with a ukulele.] Ouch-o!
",94,6,6
"19733","Hermes: [He pulls a miniature filing cabinet out of his pocket.] Here are our passports, visas, and Homeland Security permission slips, notarized and starched.
",94,6,6
"19734","Mexican border patrolman: [He looks them over.] Okay. I also would ¡ave accepted a bribe.
",94,6,6
"19735","Bender: Nice work, butterball. You know, I was in Italy last week. [He gasps]
",94,6,6
"19736","Bender: My birthplace. It's closed! There's not even a shrine to me. With a gift shop, selling piñatas of me!
",94,6,6
"19737","Hermes: End of the line, man! Come on, we can still catch a twi-night double cockfight.
",94,6,6
"19738","Bender: No wait! What's that in the Mexican garbage?
",94,6,6
"19739","Hermes: Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper.
",94,6,6
"19740","Bender: No, next to that. [He pulls out a book and shakes two owls off it] A half-eaten employee directory. [He opens it and gasps] Inspector 5's home address. [387 Avenida Con Pollo] His ass-ias is gracias!
",94,6,6
"19741","Bender: [He bursts through the door] Where are you hiding, you coward? Get out here and get murdered like a man!
",94,6,6
"19742","Hermes: [He closes the door] Bender, I'm afraid our search is at an end. He's obviously long gone.
",94,6,6
"19743","Bender: Oh yeah? Well, maybe this is him in a costume. [He picks up an iguana and begins squeezing it] I'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste.
",94,6,6
"19744","Hermes: [He helps Bender up] Okay, Bender, you're mortal. And okay, Inspector 5 screwed up. But that just makes the time you have left all the more precious. Do you really want to waste the rest of your life in a bitter, homicidal rage?
",94,6,6
"19745","Bender: [While punching the wall] No! Yes! I don't know! [He punches the wall a few more times] Why? Why did he do this to me? All I wanted was a little quality control. But he didn't care enough. And now I gonna die. I deserve better! I'm Bender, damn it! I'm Bender! [He starts crying]
",94,6,6
"19746","Hermes: There, there, mon. It's gonna be okay. You are Bender, which is something Inspector 5 will never be.
",94,6,6
"19747","Bender: You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing, [Hermes clears his throat] Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay! In fact, I'm putting you on the do-no-kill list. [Hermes smiles] Come on, fellow mortal. We're in Tijuana. I wanna live a little. [An explosion happens outside, blowing a window in.] Help, I'm gonna die! That's the opposite of what I want!
",94,6,6
"19748","Hermes: [He goes to the computer] Quick, run out the back! I'll hack into Inspector 5's terminal and fake your death, so they'll call off the Killbots.
",94,6,6
"19749","Bender: You know that terminal's unhackable! I'm not leaving you, and that's final! [An explosion rips the roof of the house] Good luck, buddy!
",94,6,6
"19750","Computer: Bender, terminated.
",94,6,6
"19751","Hermes: Bender saved.
",94,6,6
"19752","Killbot 2: Cease fire. Mom called off the attack, although I don't see how it's her–
",94,6,6
"19753","Killbot 3: Someone said ""howitzer!"" [Killbots 1 and 3 start firing on the middle Killbot, eventually blowing themselves up.]
",94,6,6
"19754","Bender: Yeah! All right! Yeah! [The house collapses. Bender groans and wipes away a tear. Hermes limbos out from under the wreckage.] He did it! And he's not even looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!
",94,6,6
"19755","Amy: What's happening? The phone's been disconnected, the ship's been repossessed, and Zoidberg's getting overcooked! [Scruffy is cooking Zoidberg on a spit.]

"19756","Bender: [He and Hermes walk in wearing sombreros.] Ah. This place never changes.
",94,6,6
"19757","Hermes: Leela! What in the name of Jah happened?
",94,6,6
"19758","Leela: Too much papers! Not enough hiding plants!
",94,6,6
"19759","Hermes: It's alright. This place just needs a one-hour bureaucratizing.
",94,6,6
"19760","Leela: [As Hermes shovels the last of the paperwork into a furnace.] You make it look so easy.
",94,6,6
"19761","Hermes: I've smoked a lot of paperwork in my day.
",94,6,6
"19762","Fry: Hey, Bender. Did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for?
",94,6,6
"19763","Bender: [Putting his arm around Hermes] Nah, but thanks to this knucklehead, I did find a new outlook on life. It's precious and sacred, and you only get so many millions of years on this Earth. So let's get brick-faced! [Everyone cheers. Everyone but Hermes runs off]
",94,6,6
"19764","Hermes: [He looks around then throws a folder into the fire. The front burns away, revealing Inspector 5 to be Hermes.]

"19765","Bender: Don't wake up Fry.
",95,6,7
"19766","Bender: My roommate's sleeping.

",95,6,7
"19768","Bender: Ah yeah, backing on up.

",95,6,7
"19790","Leela: I was. But then I realised it's actually my fault for thinking you might be on time for once. [She cleans her mouth with a napkin.] Anyhow, I ate both our lunches. You ordered the Lobster Pilé. It wasn't cheap.

Human kind is enslaved by giraffe
Men must pay for all his misdeeds
When the tree tops are stripped off their leaves
Woah-wow

",95,6,7
"19858","Female inhabitant: I see, since your time, human evolution has diverged.

",95,6,7

",95,6,7
"19861","Farnsworth: Advanced in intellect, you say? Have you invented a backwards time machine?
",95,6,7
"19862","Female inhabitant: No, but if we apply our superior minds, we can perfect such a device within five years.

",95,6,7

",95,6,7
"19866","Soldier #1: The... the machines, we built them to make our lives easier, but they rebelled. They won't stop until every human is dead.

",95,6,7
"19872","Lady #2: We too studied the time travel enigma.
",95,6,7

"19883","Fry: Bender, they had a backwards time machine.
",95,6,7
"19884","Bender: The other place had a lot of good things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?
",95,6,7
"19885","Farnsworth: Why you!
",95,6,7
"19886","Bender: Oh no, you didn't.
",95,6,7
"19887","Fry: Stop. Somewhere, some time, Leela's waiting for me. We need to keep looking for a backwards time machine.

",95,6,7
"19891","Farnsworth: I got a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we've been looking for. [This future is entirely covered in a dead desert, covering as far as the eyes can see.] Nope. [Farnsworth takes up a device that scans the area and turns up an X on its screen and buzzes.] In fact, all life is extinct.
",95,6,7
"19892","Fry: So let's keeping going forward.
",95,6,7
"19893","Farnsworth: Oh, it's no use. Earth is dead. This is the end of all things.

",95,6,7
"19901","Fry: [on card] Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we are testing the professor's dumb time machine. But you know, happy birthday and all and... [He leans closer to the card.] ... I love you. [In the background, the time machine goes off. The card vanishes away from Fry.] My card!

"19902","Old Leela: My whole life I've been mad at him. And it wasn't his fault.
",95,6,7
"19903","Leela: [voice-over] Dear Fry, our time together was short, but it was the best time of my life.
",95,6,7
"19904","Fry: You know, all in all, I had a good life. What you say the three of us grab a six pack and watch the universe end?
",95,6,7
"19905","Farnsworth: Hear, hear!
",95,6,7
"19906","Bender: That's basically what I do every day.
",95,6,7
"19907","Fry: To the end of the universe.
",95,6,7
"19908","Fry: So long, Earth. Thanks for the air and whatnot.
",95,6,7
"19909","Fry: Hey, uh, what was the purpose of life anyway?
",95,6,7
"19910","Farnsworth: Who knows? Probably some hogwash about the human spirit.
",95,6,7
"19911","Bender: Mm-hm.
",95,6,7
"19912","Fry: Sounds about right.
",95,6,7

",95,6,7

",95,6,7

",95,6,7
"19919","Bender: No thanks.
",95,6,7
"19920","Fry: Did anyone else see that?
",95,6,7

",95,6,7
"19922","Fry: It must be possible. It's happening. By the way, what's happening?
",95,6,7
"19923","Farnsworth: It appears, this universe is exactly identical to the old one. If so, we just need to keep going forward in time to the point when we left. [The Earth is forming in front of them. Volcanoes and ashes cover the surface.] The Earth is born! [It begins raining. A rock hits the Earth and the moon appears.] Ladies and gentlemen, the moon.

"19924","Fry: Look. The first fish to crawl up on land.
",95,6,7
"19925","Bender: [off screen] It was coming right at us.

"19930","Bender: Now what's going on there?
",95,6,7
"19931","Fry: History.
",95,6,7

",95,6,7
"19941","Farnsworth: Just slow it down, I'll shoot Hitler out the window. [He takes out his weapon again and aims out the window and shoots.] Darn! I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake. [He drops the weapon.] Okay. Nearing our era again. [Bender moves the leaver.] Here we go. [Bender moves the leaver.] Careful this time. [Bender moves the leaver.] Careful.
",95,6,7
"19942","New Farnsworth: We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute. [He opens the time machine with his remote.] Get in.

"19945","Farnsworth: Oh uh.
",95,6,7
"19946","Farnsworth: This new universe is about ten feet lower than our old one.
",95,6,7

",95,6,7
"19950","Fry: Oh uh, I'm late for dinner with Leela.
",95,6,7
"19951","Waiter: Welcome to Cavern on the Green. May I offer you some meatloaf while you wait?

",95,6,7

",95,6,7
"19955","Leela: I have to admit, I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
",95,6,7
"19956","Fry: That was the old Fry. He's dead now.
",95,6,7
"19957","Fry: Happy birthday, Leela. I got you a card, but I guess I kinda lost it.
",95,6,7
"19958","Leela: That's okay. I don't really like cards. What I'll remember is our time together.
",95,6,7
"19959","Leela: Aw! Nibbler made a bobo for Mamma. I'll pick it up with my super-dupey poopy scoopy. [Nibbler grumbles. A truck can be heard backing up and Leela enters the room, driving a fork-lift.]

"19960","Amy: Core magnetic field, 31 microteslas.
",96,6,8
"19961","Prof. Farnsworth: Nice.
",96,6,8
"19962","Amy: Temperature? Woah! The magma P.I. is 10,000 degrees Selleck! [Leela is emptying Nibbler's litter box in the magma. Amy swears in Cantonese.] Leela, I am collecting data. Can't you dump that somewhere else?
",96,6,8
"19963","Leela: Not really. It's highly volatile Dark Matter, and some corn.
",96,6,8
"19964","Amy: But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow and I've barely had time to prepare.
",96,6,8
"19965","Farnsworth: Nonsense. You've been my grad student for twelve years. You were ready six years ago.
",96,6,8
"19966","Amy: What?
",96,6,8
"19967","Farnsworth: I probably should have told you. Anyway, the important thing is to be relaxed tomorrow.
",96,6,8
"19968","Amy: Are you sure?
",96,6,8
"19969","Farnsworth: Yes. Do what you young people do to unwind. Take a joyride in your jalopy. Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick. Go!
",96,6,8
"19970","Kif: Okay, amigos, one teensy drink to help Amy relax. [They drink.]
",96,6,8
"19971","Amy: Hmmm. I guess I'm still kinda nervous.
",96,6,8
"19972","Leela: One more teensy drink to help Amy relax. [They press buttons on their glasses and they refill by themselves. They drink again.]
",96,6,8
"19973","Fry: Still a little nervous? [Amy burps.]
",96,6,8
"19974","Bender: She's a nervous wreck! [They refill and drink again.]
",96,6,8
"19975","Leela: [At the table with Nibbler.] Well, I may not have a man, but at least I've got you, poopsie-doodle. [She pinches his cheek.]
",96,6,8
"19976","Nibbler: [He drinks.] Leela, it's time you and I had a talk.
",96,6,8
"19977","Leela: A talk? You can't break up with me. You're my pet!
",96,6,8
"19978","Nibbler: As much as I enjoy being the object of your misplaced affections, I am also a highly sophisticated being who longs for intelligent conversation.
",96,6,8
"19979","Leela: Aw, is shnookums not feeling schtimuwated?
",96,6,8
"19980","Nibbler: An understatement, to say the least. It's time you treated me with respect.
",96,6,8
"19981","Leela: If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit.
",96,6,8
"19982","Nibbler: I keep telling you, that's my real naval uniform.
",96,6,8
"19983","Kif: Your place or mine?
",96,6,8
"19984","Amy: Both, but first, this place. [She drags him to the floor. Kif laughing nervously the entire time.]

"19985","Hedonism Bot: [Seeing the two of them.] Ooh! Room for one more? [He laughs saucily.]
",96,6,8

"19987","Alarm Clock: Sorry, I hooked up with Bender last night. Dude was all over my snooze button.

"19988","Amy: But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes! On Mars! [She runs out of bed but steps in something.] Eww! Kif, did you yack on the floor?
",96,6,8
"19989","Kif: [He is the puddle Amy walked in.] Yes, I did.
",96,6,8
"19990","Morris Katz: Where's your candidate, Farnsworth? I have a long list of students to humiliate today. [A door opens and Kif, Leela, Bender, Fry and Amy walk in.] You're late, Miss Wong.

"19991","Amy: Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares. [She is in only her bra and underpants. She screams.]
",96,6,8
"19992","Farnsworth: Here, take my lab coat. [He offers it to her. He only has suspenders and his underpants underneath it.]
",96,6,8
"19993","Katz: Allow me to introduce your examining committee in descending  order of grumpiness. Professor Ogden Wernstrom.

"19998","Shpeekenshpell: The cow says... Moo.

",96,6,8
"20002","Katz: Oh, God!
",96,6,8
"20003","Amy: A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's essentially in Perpetual Motion.

"20004","Wermstrom: [He and Katz scoff, loudly] Young lady, have you been drinking?
",96,6,8
"20005","Amy: Well, yes, but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator. [Shpeekenshpell lands on a sheep and makes a bleating noise.] Suppose this basketball is the whole world.
",96,6,8
"20006","Tate: [He is spinning a basketball on his finger.] To many young men in the inner city, it is.
",96,6,8
"20007","Amy: As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. If we could use that field to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener... Ener... [She sneezes.]

"20010","Katz: Miss Wong, I mind everything.

",96,6,8
"20032","Leela: [She is kneeling before the cat.] Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are a tewwible thweat. They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy. [Nibbler crouches and hisses like a cat.]

",96,6,8
"20051","Nibbler: The conclusion is an inescapable as it is moronic.

"20053","Nibbler: I warn you, if I have to get cute, it's gonna get ugly. [Katz still doesn't respond. Amy turns the chair.]
",96,6,8
"20054","Amy: He's dead!
",96,6,8
"20055","Nibbler: Wait. What are these strings on his lap? [He pulls them and Katz reacts.] What the... He isn't dead. He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat!
",96,6,8
"20056","Amy: So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball? [She shoots a picture of the cat.] Bad kitty!
",96,6,8
"20057","Amy: They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis! [The remaining crew are operating the ratchet, supervised by cats. Amy sneezes.] Uh-oh.
",96,6,8
"20058","Nibbler: What the... [Leela is standing in front of them. She kicks the weapons out of their hands.]
",96,6,8
"20059","Thubanian Leader: Well, look what the me dragged in.
",96,6,8
"20060","Nibbler: You can talk!
",96,6,8
"20061","Thubanian Leader: You can talk?
",96,6,8
"20062","Nibbler: How ironic. Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets!
",96,6,8
"20063","Thubanian Leader: Say, do you know Obliteron? He pretends to be a hamster, but...
",96,6,8
"20064","Amy: Yeah, that's really great. Could you please tell us what's going on?
",96,6,8
"20065","Thubanian Leader: What? Oh, right! You see, my associates and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban. Long ago, life there was ideal. [Flashback: A cat is leaping from scratching posts.] Our sun provided plenty of warm, dozy light. The chicken-salmon roamed free. [Cats pounce on the animals.] Yet disaster loomed. Our planet's rotation was gradually slowing. [Cats are sleeping at night and at day.] At first, it seemed beneficial. Long, dark nights for sleeping, long, sunny days for sleeping. But then it got too hot and too cold. [Cats are meowing in pain, surrounded by fires. Then they are freezing under piles of snow.] Our top scientists went to work, [Cats are looking through a telescope.] At last, they located a planet with the necessary orientation and magnetic field to harness the rotational energy. [The telescope focuses on Earth. End Flashback.]
",96,6,8
"20066","Nibbler: Earth!
",96,6,8
"20067","Thubanian Leader: Indubitably. Although we call it Blue Blue Shiny Ball. [Flashback to Egypt, 3,500 B.C. A saucer lands and cats get out, meowing. The Egyptians look surprised.] In the area now known as Egypt, my people constructed a giant, semi-octahedral antenna to beam Earth's rotational energy to Thuban. [Egyptians are seen building a pyramid.]
",96,6,8
"20068","Amy: The Great Pyramid at Giza!
",96,6,8
"20069","Thubanian Leader: Yes. The Egyptians viewed us as gods, but ironically that was our downfall. [The cats are surrounded by golden statues and are being fed by the Egyptians.] They pampered us with feasts most fancy and vittles most tender. We grew fat and domesticated. [A fat cat is napping on someone's lap. The cat meows a ""Duh""] Thousands of years passed, and our home world was nearing total destruction. [From space, cats can be heard meowing on Thuban. A man the next planet over yells at them to shut up.] But the technology to save our planet was lost. Lost, that is, until I heard you speak at Mars University.
",96,6,8
"20070","Amy: So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?
",96,6,8
"20071","Thubanian Leader: Welcome to Academia.
",96,6,8
"20072","Nibbler: He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy!
",96,6,8
"20073","Amy: Earth will come to a stop, and...
",96,6,8
"20074","Thubanian Leader: Half of you will cook, and half of you will freeze. Earth will be one big McDLT. We just got that commercial last year.
",96,6,8
"20075","Amy: Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire. [She gasps.] The ball of yarn! [Cats are unraveling the ""yarn"" and it is being ratcheted down.]
",96,6,8
"20076","Thubanian Leader: Quite.
",96,6,8
"20077","Nibbler: Even so, you'd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process.
",96,6,8
"20078","Thubanian Leader: Ever had a cat rub up against you?
",96,6,8
"20079","Nibbler: If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested.
",96,6,8
"20080","Thubanian Leader: I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface. Professor?
",96,6,8
"20081","Thubanian Leader: Soon the world will come to a stop, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The stopping of the world, that is. It's unstoppable. [He gives an evil laugh.] Excuse me. [He starts chewing on his paw.]
",96,6,8
"20082","Thubanian Leader: The Earth is coming to a stop. Keep your eyes on the kitties and push! [The crew are being entranced by the sight of cats playing.]
",96,6,8
"20083","Nibbler: [Locked in a pet carrier with Amy.] These space cats seem to be employing some form of hypnotic hyper-cuteness. Well, two can play that game. And one of them is me. [He puts on a face and starts cooing.]
",96,6,8
"20084","Leela: Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle? [The hypnotized crew stop and looks at Nibbler.]
",96,6,8
"20085","Thubanian Leader: Mr. Winkles, Smudge-Smudge. Quick, dance with each other.
",96,6,8
"20086","Nibbler: Aw! [He shakes himself.] Damn, they are good.
",96,6,8
"20087","Thubanian Leader: We're coming to a full stop. All cats, to your posts!
",96,6,8
"20088","Calculon: Catastrophe Beach Party. Scene One. Cue disaster effects, and action! [The entire studio gets through the air. The walls of the building fly off and the letters to the ""Hollywood"" sign follow. A man screams while shooting away.]
",96,6,8
"20089","Calculon: Cut! That extra looked at the camera. We'll have to do it again.
",96,6,8
"20090","Thubanian Leader: And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world. [He pulls a lever and a large amount of energy blast from the pyramids into space. It hits Thuban 9 and the planet starts spinning.]
",96,6,8
"20091","Thubanian: [Seeing their planet start to rotate.] Well, now, this calls for a celebration. [All the Thubanians nearby start to Can-can.]
",96,6,8
"20092","Hermes: What's all this cat hair on my sweater? [He rubs at the ""H"" on his sweater and it dissipates.]
",96,6,8
"20093","Bender: And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?
",96,6,8
"20094","Nibbler: You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats.
",96,6,8
"20095","Thubanian Leader: [The Thubanians are leaving.] Enjoy being broiled alive by the Sun and also the dead bird we've left in your slipper. [He laughs then leaves.]
",96,6,8
"20096","Farnsworth: Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth. [The ratchet won't move.]
",96,6,8
"20097","Hermes: It won't turn. Push harder, Bender!
",96,6,8
"20098","Bender: I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner.
",96,6,8
"20099","Amy: It's hopeless. Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction.
",96,6,8
"20100","Fry: Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here.
",96,6,8
"20101","Bender: [He opens a window and gets hit by flames.] Is that better?
",96,6,8
"20102","Amy: Shmezzus, it's hot! Why'd I have to invent that awful device?
",96,6,8
"20103","Farnsworth: Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used. Like the death ray.
",96,6,8
"20104","Amy: Maybe you're right. I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that... [She gasps.] That's it! Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth.
",96,6,8
"20105","Farnsworth: [He scoffs.] You can't suddenly know something just by assembling a committee of words. [He gasps.] That's it. I'll assemble your committee!
",96,6,8
"20106","Amy: The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward? [She demonstrates on the hologram.] Earth would start turning again.
",96,6,8
"20107","Wernstrom: Yes, the wrong direction! [He laughs.]
",96,6,8
"20108","Amy: So?
",96,6,8
"20109","Tate: Gentlemen, [Sexfully.] ladies, [Normally.] let's get this globe trotting.
",96,6,8
"20110","Amy: [Reading a device.] It's working! Just a little faster!
",96,6,8
"20111","Zoidberg: But we're plotzing here!
",96,6,8
"20112","Amy: Then look at Nibbler! [Nibbler is in his naval uniform. He does a little dance. Everyone speeds up.]
",96,6,8
"20113","Thubanian Leader: [Addressing numerous other Thubanians.] On the whole, Earth's society is worthless. But they do these things called antique rugs that are great for peeing on. [Thuban 9 starts shaking as the rotational energy is returned to Earth. The cats go flying.]
",96,6,8
"20114","Farnsworth: And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy.
",96,6,8
"20115","Wernstrom: I'm honored to begrudgingly present you with your Ph.D. in applied physics.
",96,6,8
"20116","Tate: Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment.
",96,6,8
"20117","Amy: Yay! I'm finally done with school. How's the job market?
",96,6,8
"20118","Shpeekenshpell: [He spins to a dog.] Ruff!
",96,6,8
"20119","Farnsworth: Congratulations, Dr. Wong!
",96,6,8
"20120","Kif: Congratulations.
",96,6,8
"20121","Nibbler: [Still dressing in his naval uniform.] Permission to come aboard?
",96,6,8
"20122","Leela: Granted, schnookums. [Nibbler climbs into Leela's lap and settles.]
",96,6,8
"20123","Farnsworth: You've got a bright future, Amy. As sure as the Sun sets in the east.
",96,6,8
"20124","Hermes: Item one... Duck! [Most duck just in time, but Bender is clipped by Cubert on a party board.]
",97,6,9
"20125","Prof. Farnsworth: Cubert, you crapscallion! What aren't you in school?
",97,6,9
"20126","Cubert: I couldn't get past the protesters. A bunch of smiling, angry people were handing out these anti-evolution flyers.
",97,6,9
"20127","Farnsworth: [He gasps.] Evolution is under attack in our schools? To the science mobile.
",97,6,9
"20128","Leela: You mean the ship?
",97,6,9
"20129","Farnsworth: Yes. The science mobile!
",97,6,9
"20130","Leela: It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay.
",97,6,9
"20131","Woman: I don't understand evolution, and I have to protect my kids from understanding it! We will not give in to the thinkers!
",97,6,9
"20132","Farnsworth: [Walking to the podium.] You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now, get back on your turnip trucks and go home!
",97,6,9
"20133","Hydroponic farmer: [Standing in front of a turnip truck.] That is an insultingly accurate stereotype, sir!
",97,6,9
"20134","Farnsworth: As a professor of science, I assure you that we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men.
",97,6,9
"20135","Dr. Banjo: I cannot speak for you, sir, but my ancestors were not monkeys. They were orangutans. Hard-working, patriotic orangutans.
",97,6,9
"20136","Farnsworth: Dr. Banjo?
",97,6,9
"20137","Dr. Banjo: In the fur. And I remind you that evolution is merely a theory. Like gravity, or the shape of the Earth.
",97,6,9
"20138","Flying Spaghetti Monster: Hey, Professor, I'm a Flying Spaghetti Monster. You seriously believe I've descended from some kind of flightless manicotti?
",97,6,9
"20139","Farnsworth: Yes!
",97,6,9
"20140","Banjo: Oh, please. A far more logical explanation is the undisprovable science of Creatureism. All life was created in its present form seven thousand years ago, by a fantastical creature from outer space!
",97,6,9
"20141","Farnsworth: Bunk!
",97,6,9
"20142","Banjo: Oh! [He shows a hologram of a man and a chimpanzee, with a backwards prohibition sign running through an arrow.] If you elitist, East Coast evolution is real, why has no one found the missing link between modern humans and ancient apes?
",97,6,9
"20143","Farnsworth: We did find it! [The arrow is replaced by Homo erectus.] It's called Homo erectus!
",97,6,9
"20144","Banjo: Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found a link between apes and this Homo erectus. [The arrow is put between before Homo erectus.]
",97,6,9
"20145","Farnsworth: Yes, they have! [The hologram fills in again.] It's called Homo habilis!
",97,6,9
"20146","Banjo: Ah-ha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so called Homo habilis.
",97,6,9
"20147","Farnsworth: Yes, they have! [The hologram fills in.] It's called Australopithecus africanus!
",97,6,9
"20148","Banjo: Oh-ho! I've got you now! [Time Lapse. The hologram now shows 19 different species of ape. Only Fry and Leela are still there.] Fair enough, but where, then, is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae? Answer me that, Professor!
",97,6,9
"20149","Farnsworth: Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!
",97,6,9
"20150","Banjo: [He scoffs.] Things don't exist simply because you believe in them. Thus sayeth the Almighty Creature in the Sky!
",97,6,9
"20151","Farnsworth: I'll show that banana-swilling, poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link.
",97,6,9
"20152","Leela: I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan. [She shows a human shaped skull with a large beak.]
",97,6,9
"20153","Farnsworth: Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup! [She throws it in a pot.]
",97,6,9
"20154","Hermes: And here's something. [He holds up a fossilized dog] Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs.
",97,6,9
"20155","Fry: Did you find something, Hermes?
",97,6,9
"20156","Hermes: [Hiding the fossil behind his back.] No. [The dog lands in the soup.]
",97,6,9

",97,6,9
"20158","Zoidberg: [He and Cubert are standing near the fossil of a long-necked reptile.] Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties! [Cubert looks at him, deadpan.] What, too soon?
",97,6,9
"20159","Cubert: I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear.
",97,6,9
"20160","Zoidberg: I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.
",97,6,9
"20161","Bender: Hey, look! I found a robot fossil! [He picks up a spring.]
",97,6,9
"20162","Farnsworth: That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils!
",97,6,9
"20163","Bender: What? Who says I didn't evolve?
",97,6,9
"20164","Farnsworth: Everybody! Robots were created quite recently. It was in all the papers.
",97,6,9
"20165","Bender: Then explain this! [He turns around and works on something. He turns around and shows the Professor. He has put eyes on the spring and mounted it on a plaque that says ""I hate Mondays"".]
",97,6,9
"20166","Farnsworth: I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann. [He throws out the skulls as he names them.] Eureka! [He is holding a skull.] It's the elusive missing missing link! This will show Banjo, once and for all!
",97,6,9
"20167","Fry: [He scoops up some soup. Amy's finger is in the spoon.] What the...
",97,6,9
"20168","Amy: Oh, that's mine. [She takes it back.]
",97,6,9
"20169","Bender: [He walks up to the Professor, wearing an under-sized Tuxedo.] Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say.
",97,6,9
"20170","Farnsworth: One might not say that! Your tux doesn't fit because you stole it from a boy!
",97,6,9
"20171","Bender: You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah.
",97,6,9
"20172","Ben Beeler: Welcome, museum members. Or, as I like to call you, future exhibits. [The crowd chuckles weakly.]
",97,6,9
"20173","Zoidberg: [To Cubert.] He's good.
",97,6,9
"20174","Beeler: Tonight, we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen, Homo farnsworth. [A curtain rises, revealing the skull and an artist's recreation of the hominid.]
",97,6,9
"20175","Farnsworth: Once again, science saves the day. The end.
",97,6,9
"20176","Beeler: And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr. Banjo!
",97,6,9
"20177","Banjo: Thank you Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has, once and for all dis-proven evolution. [He pulls a cord and a painting of Homo farnsworth riding a dinosaur is revealed.] Behold! Homo farnsworth frolicking with dinosaurs at the moment of creation.
",97,6,9
"20178","Farnsworth: I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
",97,6,9
"20179","Farnsworth: Faster! Faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there.
",97,6,9
"20180","Leela: Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless.
",97,6,9
"20181","Farnsworth: Not lifeless enough! Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it!
",97,6,9
"20182","Fry: [Looking at a polluted pond.] Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper.
",97,6,9
"20183","Farnsworth: It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long. [He rattles a tube.]
",97,6,9
"20184","Fry: What's in the tube?
",97,6,9
"20185","Farnsworth: Microscopic Nanobots. [He empties the tube. The robots quickly start cleaning the water.] They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants.
",97,6,9
"20186","Fry: Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?
",97,6,9
"20187","Farnsworth: Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry, he's been safely abandoned with his godfather.
",97,6,9
"20188","Zoidberg: Cubert,  I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch.
",97,6,9
"20189","Cubert: Why don't you just go to Hell!
",97,6,9
"20190","Zoidberg: Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?
",97,6,9
"20191","Hermes: [He walks out of the Professor's shack.] Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza?
",97,6,9
"20192","Farnsworth: You'll get your damned pizza, you parasite! First, let see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet. [He pours some water from an Erlenmeyer flask on to a microscope slide and examines it.] Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. But what's this? The Nanobots have gotten more complex.
",97,6,9
"20193","Bender: What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?
",97,6,9
"20194","Farnsworth: It wasn't by themselves! I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it!
",97,6,9
"20195","Amy: Hey look, now they gotten bigger. [The robots are coming onshore.]
",97,6,9
"20196","Farnsworth: Good heavens! Trilobots!
",97,6,9
"20197","Leela: Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!
",97,6,9
"20198","Hermes: Let's get the pizza out of here. [Hermes runs off with the pizza. The crew follows. The Trilobots cannibalize everything, including the Professor's shack and the pianos inside.]
",97,6,9
"20199","Amy: Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. It might be a cave. [The crew runs into the cave and blocks the door with a boulder.]
",97,6,9
"20200","Leela: Does anyone have a lighter?
",97,6,9
"20201","Bender: Hang on. [He opens a beer and drinks. He burps and adjusts the flame.]
",97,6,9
"20202","Leela: Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation.
",97,6,9
"20203","Hermes: It's pizza time. [He passes boxes to the rest of the crew.]
",97,6,9
"20204","Amy: Pineapple?
",97,6,9
"20205","Hermes: So much for that. [They all throw away the pizza.]
",97,6,9
"20206","Zoidberg: Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall. [He points to a crude drawing of himself and Cubert in costume.] This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?
",97,6,9
"20207","Cubert: This is sucky! You suck! Who taught you to do three-point perspective? I could make a better mural with my butt!
",97,6,9
"20208","Zoidberg: [Sadly.] Father-Man away. [He scuttles off. Cubert looks ashamed.]
",97,6,9
"20209","Hermes: Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. So what do we have to eat that's not poisoned with pineapple?
",97,6,9
"20210","Farnsworth: I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form. [He holds up a bottle that says ""Steak Dinner 40 mg. Fixin's 10 mg"".]
",97,6,9
"20211","Leela: Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots. [Bender moves the boulder.] Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!
",97,6,9
"20212","Fry: Whoa.
",97,6,9
"20213","Bender: Wow.
",97,6,9
"20214","Amy: A whole forest grew overnight.
",97,6,9
"20215","Farnsworth: [He knocks on a tree. It is metal and hollow.] All these trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up.
",97,6,9
"20216","Bender: I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up.
",97,6,9
"20217","Leela: [She gets water from the pond and re-hydrates the pill. It turns into a steak.] One thing about Bristol-Myers Squibb, they know how to cook a steak. [She takes a bite.]
",97,6,9
"20218","Fry: [In the pond, using a robotic leaf as a boat.] Look at me, I'm the Ty-D-Bol man. I own a yacht an everyone poops on me. [He is attacked by a robotic Plesiosaurs.] Help! Police!
",97,6,9
"20219","Leela: Everybody grab a club. [The rest of the crew starts hitting the robot.]
",97,6,9
"20220","Fry: [The robot throws opens its mouth and Fry hits the ground, several feet away.] Oh, big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and... [A robotic T-Rex grabs him in its jaws.]
",97,6,9
"20221","Amy: Look out for the next thing!
",97,6,9
"20222","Farnsworth: Great Scott, a Tricycle-tops!
",97,6,9
"20223","Fry: Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea. [Something crows and Fry screams. A robot Pterosaur carries him off.] This is a cool way to die!
",97,6,9
"20224","Cubert: Dr. Zoidberg? I'm sorry for treating you like a total Zoidberg... I mean, loser. [Zoidberg comes out of his dumpster.]
",97,6,9
"20225","Zoidberg: Go on.
",97,6,9
"20226","Cubert: It's just that I get bullied a lot. I guess I kinda make fun of people as a defense mechanism.

",97,6,9
"20230","Brett: [He laughs.] The pee-babies peed themselves. I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads.

"20232","Cubert: Woah! You're like some kind of dumpster Jedi.
",97,6,9
"20233","Zoidberg: So, you wanna come in maybe? [He opens the other lid.] I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it.

"20234","Fry: [Trying to avoid the babies Pterosaurs.] Ah! Don't eat my butt!
",97,6,9
"20235","Leela: If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us.
",97,6,9
"20236","Farnsworth: Look out, a solar flare!
",97,6,9
"20237","Amy: What the shmell happened?
",97,6,9
"20238","Farnsworth: A mass extinction. [Fry lands unceremoniously near them.] That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs.
",97,6,9
"20239","Leela: Convenient.
",97,6,9
"20240","Farnsworth: Only puny, mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe.
",97,6,9
"20241","Bender: Guys, guys! I taught myself to knit.
",97,6,9
"20242","Farnsworth: Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet!
",97,6,9
"20243","Farnsworth: Oh, well, it took almost two hours, but it's finished. [The crew cheers.] Now let's go... to sleep. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise.
",97,6,9
"20244","Bender: Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on. [Time Lapse. Bender is sleeping on top of Fry, Hermes, and the Professor.]

",97,6,9
"20246","Hermes: Sweet robot swan of Botswana!
",97,6,9
"20247","Bender: Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night, huh?
",97,6,9
"20248","Farnsworth: Whatever.
",97,6,9
"20249","Fry: Hey, looky there. [Amy and Leela are still being abducted.]
",97,6,9
"20250","Hermes: Those robo-cavemen have kidnapped our human regular-women!
",97,6,9
"20251","Fry: We gotta save them! But the only weapon we have is my fan dance. [He shows off a fan.]
",97,6,9
"20252","Farnsworth: Hmm, I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants. [His pants fall down.]
",97,6,9
"20253","Amy: I think they want wives, so just play along. If it doesn't work out, we'll still get half their rocks.
",97,6,9
"20254","Leela: I can earn my own rocks! Also, I don't want any rocks!
",97,6,9
"20255","Farnsworth: Well, it took almost twelve hours, but it's finished.
",97,6,9
"20256","Hermes: It's too dark now, but first thing tomorrow we'll slingshot them like they've never been slangshat. [They go into their cave.]
",97,6,9
"20257","Fry: What's going on? How did we save you?
",97,6,9
"20258","Amy: It was the weirdest thing. We went to sleep, and when we woke up, our cave husbands were gone.

"20259","Leela: I'm gonna miss Spencer.

",97,6,9
"20267","Widnar: Amazing. [She pokes Hermes.] I've theorized that carbon-based, fat-filled life could exist, but until today, I never had any proof.

",97,6,9
"20269","Widnar: Welcome, museum members, or, as I like to call you, future exhibits. [A robot coughs.] I now present my latest discovery, the amazing non-mechanical man, Homo farnsworth.
",97,6,9
"20270","Farnsworth: Thank you. I must say, I'm so proud to see what you've blossomed into since I first created your ancestors.
",97,6,9
"20271","Widnar: What?
",97,6,9
"20272","Farnsworth: I thought you knew. You all evolved from some filth-gobbling Nanobots I designed. I dumped them in one of your ponds a few days ago.
",97,6,9
"20273","Widnar: But this is Creationist talk!
",97,6,9
"20274","Robot Farnsworth: He speaks lies! The Earth was created in eons not days.
",97,6,9
"20275","Farnsworth: Yes, relative to you, it was eons, but, well, look at this hologram I took the day before yesterday of a robot frolicking with a robo-dinosaur. [He shows a hologram of Bender riding one of the dinosaurs. The crowd gasps again.]

"20276","Widnar: I don't want to live on this planet anymore! [She blasts off.]

"20287","Bender: Thank you. Your Honor, this meat-man does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution.

Yes, it's completely crazy, and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity! [Everyone gasps again.]
",97,6,9
"20288","Farnsworth: Objection, I'm not crazy! I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave. If you don't believe me, ask my uncle.

"20296","Banjo: Well, digital photographs don't lie. I admit that what you witnessed may have been some form of evolution.
",97,6,9
"20297","Farnsworth: I'm glad you agree, Dr. Banjo.
",97,6,9
"20298","Banjo: Evolution set into motion by a wise and all-knowing Creator. You.
",97,6,9
"20299","Farnsworth: [He chuckles.] Well I don't know about all-knowing. And I admit it's possible, however unlikely, that some wise and all-knowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth.
",97,6,9
"20300","Bender: And the Creator could also be a robot.
",97,6,9
"20301","Farnsworth: Then who built this so-called Creator-robot?

"20316","Linda: [on TV.] Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived aboard his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht.

",98,6,10
"20320","Bender: True. I've always dreamt of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult.
",98,6,10

",98,6,10
"20322","Bender: I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
",98,6,10
"20323","Amy: Never! [She walks away.]
",98,6,10
"20324","Bender: A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.

"20329","Farnsworth: There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.
",98,6,10
"20330","Amy: Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?
",98,6,10
"20331","Farnsworth: Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life.
",98,6,10
"20332","Amy: Like the heaps of dead monkeys?
",98,6,10
"20333","Farnsworth: Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe.
",98,6,10
"20334","Amy: I wasted my youth porking out.
",98,6,10
"20335","Farnsworth: Yes, I remember. [He points to a picture of a fat Amy, captioned ""2997 Employee of the Year"".]
",98,6,10
"20336","Amy: Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
",98,6,10
"20337","Farnsworth: Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones. [He moves his coat and shows that he is just skin and bones.] Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust.
",98,6,10
"20338","Amy: [She gasps.] We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us! [They sit in the chairs.] Wait, can I still change my mind?

Amy is eating Bologna substitute from a squeeze bottle.] I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping every which way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies.

"20343","Amy: [in Farnsworth’s body.] Professor, what's not happening?
",98,6,10
"20344","Farnsworth: [in Amy’s body.] Bad news, me. [He presses a button and a diagram of their brains comes up.] I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response.
",98,6,10
"20345","Amy: [in Farnsworth’s body.] You idiot!
",98,6,10
"20346","Farnsworth: [in Amy’s body.] Once two bodies have switched minds, they can never switch back. [A dramatic cord plays as Amy covers her mouth.] However, perhaps they can. Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space.

",98,6,10
"20354","Bender: [in Amy’s body.] Stupid, air-needing lungs. [He climbs onto the boat. He gasps.] The crown jewels. Now I just have to locate the guard and seduce him in... [He checks the watch.] Four seconds?

"20374","Nikolai: Now then, what is a filthy human doing aboard my royal yacht?
",98,6,10

"20450","Farnsworth: [in Bender’s body.] I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?

"20465","Leela: [in Farnsworth’s body.] Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?

"20472","Zoidberg: [in Fry's body.] Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday. [He opens the door and looks inside.] A floor? We live like kings?

"20475","Nikolai: [in the wash bucket’s body.] [Finding cigars in a cabinet.]  Ah, cigars. Light me up, old friend. [Zoidberg pulls out a lighter. Cut to outside where a fireball shoots out of the building. Bender, in Nikolai's body, runs past. Basil and Flavia are chasing him. Two robots walk in front of Bender.]
",98,6,10
"20476","Robot: There you are, Emperor Nikolai. It's time for your speech to the UN.

",98,6,10
"20488","Basil: [He jumps onto the stage and holds Bender at sword-point.] Ladies and gentlemen, this robot is an impostor! [The ambassadors all gasp. The Chinese ambassador puts his hand to his translator and listens. After a moment, he gasps. Basil turns on his sword.] I shall enjoy this.

"20593","Ndnd: I send you out to conquer a planet and all you bring back is J.J. Abrams' face? [A face is lying in a box, nearby.]
",99,6,11
"20594","Lrrr: I thought you'd like it. You haven't even tried it on.
",99,6,11
"20595","Ndnd: I might dress up in a face if you ever took me anywhere nice!
",99,6,11
"20596","Lrrr: Oh, boy, here we go. I built this castle with my own two slaves. What are you gonna to do, kick me out?
",99,6,11
"20597","Lrrr: I am Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8. May I crash on your couch?
",99,6,11
"20598","Farnsworth: So he just showed up unannounced, raided the liquor cabinet, sprayed urine on the ceiling and passed out?
",99,6,11
"20599","Amy: And the walls.
",99,6,11
"20600","Lrrr: Leave me alone. My wife hates me and planetary conquest has become a chore.
",99,6,11
"20601","Farnsworth: There, there. You're just having a mid-life crisis.
",99,6,11
"20602","Lrrr: Mid-life crisis, eh? [He pulls out a ray-gun.] Lrrr demands the comfort of pop-psychological platitudes.
",99,6,11
"20603","Bender: Look, hoss, your wife threw you out. That's your license to be a jerk. Do whatever the hell you want then walk away and light a cigar. [He pulls a cigar out of his chest cabinet, lights it, and walks away.
",99,6,11
"20604","Leela: Don't listen to him, Lrrr. Bender may seem happy. [Bender can be heard laughing.] But in the long-tern, you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd.
",99,6,11
"20605","Lrrr: Yes, it's clear what I must do.
",99,6,11
"20606","Lrrr: I like it.
",99,6,11
"20607","Surgeon: I'm thinking we downplay those hideous growths on your head. [A hologram shows Lrrr and it is changed to make him seem human with full hair.]
",99,6,11
"20608","Lrrr: Horns are a sign of virility. Also, they house my testes.
",99,6,11
"20609","Surgeon: I'm thinking horn extension.
",99,6,11
"20610","Bender: You'll need some arm candy. It's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape, middle-aged creeps like you. Yeah, I said it! What's your time, Borgnine?
",99,6,11
"20611","Lrrr: Big and angry. [He unzips his jacket and pulls out a magazine. He unfolds several pages to reveal a picture of a naked Omicronian woman. Bender's eyes zoom in then suddenly wilt.]
",99,6,11
"20612","Bender: Look, brah, you just not gonna find a whole lot of hot, gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system.
",99,6,11
"20613","Lrrr: There's one! [He stuffs his magazine into his jacket as the woman walks over.]
",99,6,11
"20614","Grrrl: Hey, cool cape. Were'd you get it?
",99,6,11
"20615","Lrrr: What, this old thing? I murdered my father. My name's Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
",99,6,11
"20616","Grrrl: I am called Grrrl.
",99,6,11
"20617","Lrrr: Of the planet Omicron Persei 8? That is a pretty name.

"20618","Lrrr: What's on the TV tonight? Oh, wait! I don't care, because I've got a date!
",99,6,11
"20619","Leela: I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think this is a mistake.
",99,6,11
"20620","Fry: Leela's right. That's not what you want to hear. What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book. Now the hero is more reliable because he has no more ridiculous powers.
",99,6,11
"20621","Lrrr: Let's watch, shall we.
",99,6,11
"20622","Invader X: One more step and little Miss Constructive Criticism here gets it!
",99,6,11
"20623","Delivery-Boy Man: Oh, yeah? I may be just a simple delivery boy with no superpowers, so there's nothing I can do.
",99,6,11
"20624","Invader X: Okay. [He disintegrates Lane. Delivery-Boy Man bursts into tears.]
",99,6,11
"20625","Fry: So? Give me your honest praise.
",99,6,11
"20626","Leela: Fry, I've now seen two comic books, so listen to me. Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry?
",99,6,11
"20627","Lrrr: Hmm. That dinner was a worthy foe.
",99,6,11
"20628","Grrrl: Yes, we shall not see its like again. So, um... [She begins kissing Lrrr.]
",99,6,11
"20629","Lrrr: Um, I'm sorry. I haven't done this for a while. I just got partway out of a bad relationship.
",99,6,11
"20630","Grrrl: Maybe I should take this off. [She begins taking off her dress and Lrrr's laser fires. Grrrl reaches back and unzips her costume, revealing her to be a human.]
",99,6,11
"20631","Lrrr: [He screams.] You're a human?
",99,6,11
"20632","Grrrl: Only physically. I'm a cross-species dresser. [She hangs up the costume.] Wait, you're an actual Omicronian?
",99,6,11
"20633","Lrrr: Oh, God. Oh God, what have I done?
",99,6,11
"20634","Grrrl: This is so hot! Conquer me, Lrrr! Sharpen your horns on my scaly thorax! [She jumps him.]
",99,6,11
"20635","Lrrr: [Sobbing.] I want to go home! But Ndnd would never take me back now.
",99,6,11
"20636","Leela: Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants, to feel like you're listening to her nagging. Is there anything she has been riding your ass about?
",99,6,11
"20637","Lrrr: Conquering things, I guess. I could conquer Earth, kill all humans.
",99,6,11
"20638","Bender: There's a thought.
",99,6,11
"20639","Leela: No! We don't need a war of the worlds.
",99,6,11
"20640","Fry: That's it! We need a War of the Worlds! I'll call Orson Welles [He begins dialing his cell phone.]
",99,6,11
"20641","Bender: Dork calling Orson! Dork calling Orson!
",99,6,11
"20642","Welles: You're asking me, the renowned spokesperson for Paul Masson wine, to recreate my brilliant  1938 radio broadcast merely to deceive and impress the wife of this skinny reptile?
",99,6,11
"20643","Fry: Sorry. Never mind.
",99,6,11
"20644","Welles: I do it for free.

",99,6,11
"20646","Welles: [on TV.] I'm speaking to you from the hickory farms in Grover's Mall, New Jersey,  [on the TV, an image of the Planet Express building appears. It has a sign that says Grover's Mall and a poorly designed, fake flying saucer is being dangled in front of the camera. Amy and Hermes exit the building, carrying a picnic basket.] through a mouthful of summer sausage, mmm, where I hardly know where to being. Mmm! [The scene of TV changes the saucer being dangled over a city made of household items.] A huge spacecraft, piloted by a devastatingly handsome... Now, how, in God's name, do I know what the fellow looks like if he's inside a ship miles in the air? [The scene cuts back to Planet Express.] It's just foolish on its face.
",99,6,11
"20647","Fry: If you want the cheese log, you'll read what I wrote.
",99,6,11
"20648","Welles: Very well. I shall comply.

"20649","Welles: I'm getting reports that cities across the globe are being destroyed by this noble invader, whose good looks are apparently discernible across vast distances and through solid metal. [The ""spacecraft"" lands in front of the White House and Lrrr walks up.] But wait, the leader of the attack is swaggering out of his ship and up to a convenient nearby microphone. Now why couldn't I have just described his appearance at this point? This is the type of thing I'm talking about.
<poem>Lrrr: People of Earth, I am Lrrr, conqueror of your planet. [He whispers to the Planet Express crew.] Cue screams. [They scream.] You will now remove your skulls and play dodgeball with them for my amusement.

"20670","Nixon: Got it. Peace with honor. Well, I resign again.
",99,6,11
"20671","Ndnd: Come, Nixon. Introduce me to the kitchen staff. I must lay down the law about Lrrr's low sodium diet. [She, Zapp and Nixon leave. Lrrr starts eating peanuts.]

[In the film, the Land Titanic takes off. People are watching it sail.] Just four days into her maiden voyage, as we approached 32 Street, the line-liner struck a mailbox and went down. [In the film, we see one of the Land Titanic's wheels hit a mailbox. The ship starts falling through the street.]  2000 souls were lost that day, including my dear husband. In loving memory, I established the Mr. Astor Endowment, which this year supports the United Mutant Scholarship Fund.

[Mutants can be seen trying to get onto the cars.] But the places were all taken by surface passengers. As my mother held me tight, I suddenly felt the gentle tap of a cane on my face. I turned to see the kindly smile of Mr. Astor. [In the present, Mrs. Astor looks on in shock. Hobsy covers a second missile.] [In the flashback, Mr. Astor gets up and offers them his seat.

Is the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle.

",102,6,14
"21296","Professor Farnsworth: Gadzooks! [Professor Farnsworth enlightens Billy West's head.] Bender's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories. When the Feds bumpkinised him, they completely wiped out his old identity!

"21412","Zoidberg: I remember. I remember! [Zoidberg walks up to the table.] This is what traumatised me. Such a meal to got to waste! [Zoidberg takes his helmet off, throws it away, and eats the food.] And, with that... [Zoidberg burps.] I have closure.

",103,6,15
"21415","Zoidberg: Oh, right! And there was a giant killer space whale.
",103,6,15

",103,6,15

"22054","Professor Farnsworth: Not now! [Professor Farnsworth lets go of Zoidberg and turns back.] Hypermalaria can lie dormant for years. [Professor Farnsworth turns to Zoidberg.] Isn't that what you said?
",106,6,18
"22055","Zoidberg: It sounds like something I would say.
",106,6,18
"22056","Professor Farnsworth: So stay with me until the symptoms start. Then... [Professor Farnsworth puts his right hand on his chest.] Put me out of my misery. You must swear!
",106,6,18
"22057","Zoidberg: Alright, Hubert. [Zoidberg puts his right claw on Professor Farnsworth's right arm and smiles.] I swear.
",106,6,18
"22058","Professor Farnsworth: It's started, Zoidberg. The fever. The muscle spasms. [Professor Farnsworth slaps himself twice with each hand.] I'm dying. [Professor Farnsworth coughs aggressively.] It's time for you to keep your promise and kill me.
",106,6,18
"22059","Zoidberg: This is very difficult. [Zoidberg opens his eyes.] But I'll try... [Zoidberg turns to Professor Farnsworth.] Friend.
",106,6,18
"22060","Professor Farnsworth: No! Wait! [Professor Farnsworth puts his hands on Zoidberg's arms.] I'm afraid to die!
",106,6,18
"22061","Zoidberg: Argh! [Zoidberg's fin disappears.] You said you wanted me to kill you! [Zoidberg points at Professor Farnsworth with his right claw.] Is this one o' those ""No means yes"" deals?!
",106,6,18
"22062","Professor Farnsworth: Yes and no. [Professor Farnsworth stands up and points at Zoidberg with his left hand.] I do want you to kill me. But I mustn't see it coming. That would be agony! [Professor Farnsworth walks up to Zoidberg.] So you must murder me completely by surprise.
",106,6,18
"22063","Zoidberg: As God is my witness, you can count on me. [Zoidberg points at himself with his right claw twice.] Well... See you tomorrow.
",106,6,18
"22064","Professor Farnsworth: Not surprising enough!
",106,6,18
"22065","Professor Farnsworth: Eh, wha?! Oh! [Professor Farnsworth screams effeminately and puts his right hand on his chest.] My... [Zoidberg stops approaching Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth grunts.] Heart!

"22066","Fry: Hey!
",106,6,18
"22067","Leela: What are you doing there?
",106,6,18
"22068","Professor Farnsworth: Whoa! [Zoidberg grabs Professor Farnsworth's coat.] Whoa! [Leela runs on top of the conference table. Fry runs on the floor.] Whoa! [Leela grabs Zoidberg. Zoidberg is holding Professor Farnsworth's coat. Professor Farnsworth has fallen. Fry grabs the remote control. The song stops playing. Fry makes the remote-controlled airplane fly by Professor Farnsworth.] Whoa!
",106,6,18
"22069","Zoidberg: Stop! You don't understand!
",106,6,18
"22070","Leela: Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!
",106,6,18
"22071","Fry: Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops.

"22072","Professor Farnsworth: Whoa! Whoa! Woo!
",106,6,18
"22073","Zoidberg: You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!
",106,6,18
"22074","Bender: Ooh.
",106,6,18
"22075","Zoidberg: Hubert... I'm sorry. [Zoidberg grabs a lock of white hair from the coat.] Wha?! He doesn't have hair. [Zoidberg puts the lock of white hair on a microscope and looks inside it with his left eye.] Great Little Caesar's ghost!
",106,6,18
"22076","Professor Farnsworth: You fools! [Professor Farnsworth takes the towel off his head and turns to his left.] You stupid, life-prolonging fools! [Hermes, Leela, Fry, Bender, and Amy are also present. Fry has crossed his arms.] I asked Zoidberg to kill me!
",106,6,18
"22077","Amy: Huh?!
",106,6,18
"22078","Bender: What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!
",106,6,18
"22079","Hermes: Professor, have you gone mad?!
",106,6,18
"22080","Professor Farnsworth: Probably! [Professor Farnsworth puts the towel back on his head.] It's one o' the symptoms of Tritonian hypermalaria!
",106,6,18
"22081","Amy: You mean the incurable disease that causes fever... [Professor Farnsworth squeezes the towel, making a pool on the floor.] Spasms... [Professor Farnsworth punches himself with his right hand, dropping the towel on the floor, punches himself with his left hand, and slaps himself with his right hand.] Insanity... [Professor Farnsworth looks up, laughs maniacally, and kicks the pool four times with his right foot and five times with his left foot.] Coma... [Professor Farnsworth falls over.] And finally death?!
",106,6,18
"22082","Professor Farnsworth: Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery! [Professor Farnsworth points at the door with his right hand.] Bring 'im! [Professor Farnsworth violently hits his chin with his right knee, grunts, puts his hands on his chin, and leans back in his chair.] Quickly!
",106,6,18
"22083","Scruffy: Hmmm. Should've known better than to store my antiques in the office.
",106,6,18

",106,6,18
"22087","Leela: Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves.

",106,6,18
"22089","Walt: We have a situation, Mother. This creature tried to sand-crab into the building.

"22092","Mom: [to the two men] Let him go [to Larry, Walt, and Igner] and stooge the hell out of here!

"22098","Mom: John Zoidberg... It's been a long time. How've you been?
",106,6,18
"22099","Zoidberg: Not too bad. [Zoidberg sits down.] Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon. [Zoidberg points at Mom with his right claw.] Later, I'll show you the pictures.
",106,6,18
"22100","Mom: Do you ever regret it, John? [Mom walks up to Zoidberg and leans over him.] Leaving me to work for the Professor?
",106,6,18
"22101","Zoidberg: What do you want me to say? [Zoidberg shrugs.] 'E saved my life.
",106,6,18
"22102","Mom: Oh, big deal! You could've been rich if you'd stayed. [Mom points at Zoidberg with her left hand.] Your own lab... A full staff...
",106,6,18
"22103","Zoidberg: But Hubert is my friend. [Zoidberg closes his eyes.] 'E's very sick. [Zoidberg opens his eyes and points at himself with his left claw.] I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing... [The camera zooms in on Zoidberg's face.] From Triton!
",106,6,18
"22104","Mom: It'll cost you, John. [Mom turns to her left and lifts up her right hand.] How much are you worth now?
",106,6,18
"22105","Zoidberg: I live in a dumpster. [Zoidberg pulls a piece of paper out of his coat with his right claw.] All I have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon.
",106,6,18
"22106","Mom: [sad] Oh, John. [Mom points at Zoidberg with her left hand.] That's really all you have? [Zoidberg nods.] [happy] Then I'll take it.

",106,6,18
"22108","Bender: I said I'd kill 'im myself! [Bender raises his arms and then crosses them.] Nobody listens to Bender!

"22109","Leela: We all have to share in the guilt. [Leela turns to Bender.] Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by.

"22122","Zoidberg: [off camera] What the hell are you doing?!
",106,6,18
"22123","Leela: [off camera] Zoidberg! [Leela descends through the elevator and runs towards Zoidberg.] [on camera] We know about your secret agreement. [Leela points at herself with both her hands.] I am so, so sorry for how we treated you.
",106,6,18
"22124","Fry: And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria.
",106,6,18
"22125","Zoidberg: 'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots! [We hear a growling sound. The camera zooms out, revealing Scruffy and Professor Farnsworth. Professor Farnsworth, who has grown white hair, sits up as he growls.] 'E has Yetiism. [Leela, Fry, Bender, Amy, and Hermes gasp. Zoidberg walks up to the bed.] When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!
",106,6,18
"22126","Fry: Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine. [Fry points at the Professor Farnsworth Yeti with his left hand.] And I've never heard of Yetiism.
",106,6,18
"22127","Zoidberg: It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly. [The Professor Farnsworth Yeti lies down.] Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti! [The wheel approaches Zoidberg. Zoidberg avoids the wheel and makes a strange sound. The wheel lands next to a set of logs, above which is a kettle, and its flaming tube burns it. The camera zooms in on the kettle. The water in the kettle begins evaporating.] Wow! [The Professor Farnsworth Yeti begins screaming.] Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote.
",106,6,18
"22128","Leela: Another Yeti?!
",106,6,18
"22129","Zoidberg: Yes. [Zoidberg looks at the Yeti's head.] The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast. [Zoidberg pulls a giant bolt out of his right pocket with his right claw.] Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted? [Zoidberg grunts as he extracts a gland from the Yeti's head.] Ah, yes. [Zoidberg holds up the gland.] This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin.
",106,6,18
"22130","Hermes: But that's what gave 'im Yetiism in the first place! Won't it just make 'im a double Yeti?!
",106,6,18
"22131","Zoidberg: Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!
",106,6,18
"22132","Fry: My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!
",106,6,18
"22133","Zoidberg: No time for an injection. [Zoidberg grabs the gland with his mouth hand, throws the giant bolt away, climbs the Professor Farnsworth Yeti, holds its head with his claws, opens its mouth with two of his mouth fingers, and spits the gland into it. The Professor Farnsworth Yeti closes its mouth, swallows the gland, and throws Zoidberg away with its left hand.] Uh! [Zoidberg hits the wall, makes a strange sound, falls on the floor, and grunts. The Professor Farnsworth Yeti grows in size.] [off camera] I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!

"22134","Amy: [sad] It wasn't supposed to do any of those things.

"22135","Professor Farnsworth: You did it, Johnny. I'm cured!
",106,6,18
"22136","Bender: Wow! [Professor Farnsworth begins getting off the remains. Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth hug. The camera zooms out, revealing Hermes, Leela, Fry, Amy, Bender, and Scruffy. Bender turns to the others.] Alright, let's set it up and try again.
",106,6,18
"22137","Professor Farnsworth: There's one thing I don't understand, Zoidberg. [Leela, Bender, Amy, and Zoidberg are also present. Amy is sitting on the couch's right arm.] How did you persuade Mom to give you her precious Yeti head? Did you 'ave to promise anything in return?
",106,6,18
"22138","Zoidberg: [sad] Nothing. Nothing at all.
",106,6,18
"22139","Amy: This calls for a celebration! Come on, everyone! [Amy stands up.] Let's go tanning!

"22154","Bender: See, buddy? It's not so scary.
",107,6,19
"22155","Fry: I feel better now. [The parade continues. Two men dressed in green are holding a sign reading St. Patrick's Day Parade, a dragon is sustaining a sign reading CHINESE NEW YEAR PARADE, six blue Aliens are circling the road in their spaceships, and Bender is still carrying Fry on his back.] Why is so many different parades smooshed together?

"22157","Fry: What's Parade Day?
",107,6,19
"22158","Professor Farnsworth: It used to be that every group in New New York wanted their own parade. Why, when I was a boy, we had a parade every day. Those were dark times.

"22223","Robot Devil: Fry? I hate that guy. We once traded hands. [The Robot Devil smells his hands.] They still stink of candy corn!
",107,6,19
"22224","Bender's ghost: Get this: That jerk said Human life was more valuable than Robot life!
",107,6,19
"22225","Robot Devil: What?! [The Robot Devil jumps onto his desk and flames rise up behind him.] After all you've done for him, Fry must die.
",107,6,19
"22226","Bender's ghost: I know, right? I'd murder him good if only I was still alive.
",107,6,19
"22227","Robot Devil: Bender, would you like to make a deal?
",107,6,19
"22228","Bender's ghost: I'm not stupid... [Bender's ghost crosses his arms.] So yes, absolutely. [Bender's ghost grabs the pen and signs the contract.] What have I agreed to?
",107,6,19
"22229","Robot Devil: I'll return you to your body... After you use your ghostly powers to scare Fry to death!
",107,6,19
"22230","Bender's ghost: That sounds fair and also fun. I like that there's no catch this time.
",107,6,19
"22231","Robot Devil: But wait. There's a catch.
",107,6,19
"22232","Bender's ghost: Crap!
",107,6,19
"22233","Robot Devil: If you fail, you'll spend eternity here in Robot Hell. Which, as luck would have it, is where I rehearse my band. [to the Robot Demons] Hit it, boys! [The Robot Demons begin playing. The first Demon is at the piano, the second is at the drums, which bear the Devil's face, and the third is at the trumpet.] [singing] Cigars are evil. You won't miss 'em—
",107,6,19
"22234","Bender's ghost: Okay! I'll do it, I'll do it. Just stop the damn music!
",107,6,19
"22235","Bender's ghost: Scare Fry to death? Ha. I could do that in my sleep. [Bender's ghost woos, but Fry does not react.] What are you, deaf?
",107,6,19
"22236","Bender's ghost: Soap. I know Fry's afraid of that. [Bender's ghost rubs his hands.] Maybe he'll die if I rub 'im all over with it real slow. [Bender's ghost grunts as he tries to grab the soap, never succeeding. He is accidentally absorbed into a hair dryer. The hair dryer powers up.] Whoa, it's sick! My software can control electronics.
",107,6,19
"22237","Fry: What the— [Bender's ghost flies into Fry's toothbrush. It, too, attacks Fry. Fry screams as he attempts to free himself from the toothbrush. Bender's ghost flies into a razor, turns it on, and starts flying around Fry.] No! Not the armpits! Winter's coming!
",107,6,19
"22238","Hermes: As you can see, since Bender's death, requests to bite one's shiny metal ass are down 98%. [Scruffy starts vacuum-cleaning with Bender's compartment, leg, and footcup. The crew looks at him.] Do you mind doing that later?!
",107,6,19
"22239","Scruffy: Bite my shiny metal ass.
",107,6,19
"22240","Fry: Help! I was attacked in my bathroom! By my bathroom! I'm being haunted by a ghost!
",107,6,19
"22241","Amy: Fry... You're just upset because you drove Bender to suicide. Here, take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls.
",107,6,19
"22242","Bender's ghost: Alright. I got 'im all heebie-jeebied with my bathroom harass. [Bender's ghost rubs his hands.] One more good scare and I'll be outta Limbo!
",107,6,19
"22243","Hermes: Did someone say Limbo?
",107,6,19
"22244","Bender's ghost: Hold on to your dookie. It's about to get spooky.
",107,6,19
"22245","Fry: I'm tellin' ya. Somethin' supernatural is happening. I'm scared to death!
",107,6,19
"22246","Leela: Stop being ridiculous. There's no such thing as whatever you're saying.
",107,6,19
"22247","Fry: [as he is slapped] Ow! Ow! Ow!
",107,6,19
"22248","Leela: Whoa. Maybe you're right. I only meant to slap you twice.
",107,6,19
"22249","Fry: All I know is I've got a ghost that needs busting.
",107,6,19
"22250","Hermes: Who you gonna call?
",107,6,19
"22251","Fry: Gho—
",107,6,19
"22252","Female voice: The number you have dialled has been lame since 1989.
",107,6,19
"22253","Fry: Now do you believe me?!
",107,6,19
"22254","Professor Farnsworth: Oh, fuff. [Professor Farnsworth stands up.] Enough of your superstitious nonsense. I'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science.
",107,6,19
"22255","Gypsy: Let the séance begin!
",107,6,19
"22256","Professor Farnsworth: I said science!
",107,6,19
"22257","Gypsy: The veil is lifting. I am gazing into the spirit world... And... Nothing. [to Fry] You said something about a buffet?
",107,6,19
"22258","Bender's ghost: I'm right here, you lazy shyster!
",107,6,19
"22259","Gypsy: [calmly, as she is attacked] Wait. I'm sensing something.
",107,6,19
"22260","Bender's ghost: I'm rich! [Bender's ghost makes sounds of excitement, but realises that he cannot reach the coins.] Aw.
",107,6,19
"22261","Fry: [to the gypsy] Is it a ghost?!
",107,6,19
"22262","Gypsy: There's no such thing as ghosts, you donkey monkey! It's a Robot ghost.
",107,6,19
"22263","Fry: A Robot ghost?! What Robot would wanna haunt me?
",107,6,19
"22264","Bender's ghost: Me, dumbass! Bender, Bender, Bender, Bender! [Fry scratches his back with Bender's arm.] Aw! [to the gypsy] Tell 'im, you baggy, old crone!
",107,6,19
"22265","Professor Farnsworth: Finally! Any more ridiculous ideas?
",107,6,19
"22266","Reverend Preacherbot: Hallelujah! [Reverend Preacherbot stands in front of the door and it is opened by Leela.] I'm here to conduct a exorcism and avail myself of the buffet. [Reverend Preacherbot takes his hat off, gives it to Leela, and enters.] Can I get an amen and a goodly helpin' of Scruffy's famous corn biscuits?
",107,6,19
"22267","Scruffy: Right away, Reverend.
",107,6,19
"22268","Reverend Preacherbot: Oh, Lord. I got the too much macaroni sweats. Now where's this alleged apparition? [Reverend Preacherbot screams after seeing several machines flying around Fry, who is sitting on the floor, helpless. The machines are being controlled by Bender's ghost.] Might be a problem with your circuit breaker. See ya.
",107,6,19
"22269","Fry: Please! I'm under constant attack by machinery. I can't sleep, I can't think. I can't even think!
",107,6,19
"22270","Reverend Preacherbot: Very well. [Reverend Preacherbot puts a box on the floor, opens it, and grabs an object consisting of a parallelepiped and a pyramid.] This sacramental firewall scans for and removes ghostware in a twenty-foot radius.
",107,6,19
"22271","Bender's ghost: Bring it on, holy man!
",107,6,19
"22272","Reverend Preacherbot: Carry this at all times and the demon cannot harm you. It also keeps cats off the sofa. By killin' 'em!
",107,6,19
"22273","Fry: So quiet! So peaceful! Time to lower my guard even for a minute. [Fry throws the firewall onto the bed. It projects a holographic image of his face that melts down into a skull and he screams. Fry's heart is now beating noticeably fast and Fry begins to faint.] A heart attack! [Fry's heart stops beating.] Yup, I was right.
",107,6,19
"22274","Bender's ghost: Okay, Beelze. Fry's dead.
",107,6,19
"22275","Robot Devil: A ghost! [Bender's ghost approaches the Robot Devil.] Oh, it's you.
",107,6,19
"22276","Bender's ghost: A deal's a deal, so give me my body back.
",107,6,19
"22277","Robot Devil: Fry's dead, you say? Funny. That's not what it says on his Wikipedia page.
",107,6,19
"22278","Bender's ghost: Survived the heart attack?! Damn you, Obamacare!
",107,6,19
"22279","Dr. Cahill: I'm afraid your heart has suffered a lot of damage, Mr. Fry. And my cleavage isn't helping.
",107,6,19
"22280","Professor Farnsworth: [smiling] Not helping him.
",107,6,19
"22281","Dr. Cahill: One more sudden shock will kill you.
",107,6,19
"22282","Bender's ghost: Sudden? That's just the kind of one more shock I was plannin'.
",107,6,19
"22283","Fry: The machines. They're after me!
",107,6,19
"22284","Dr. Cahill: You're suffering from machine phobia. Your only hope is to go to the Amish homeworld, where no machines are allowed.
",107,6,19
"22285","Fry: I guess it's for the best. [Bender's ghost's head emerges from the heart monitor and woos.] The only machine I'll ever miss is... [Fry whimpers.] Bender.
",107,6,19
"22286","Bender's ghost: Say what?
",107,6,19
"22287","Fry: Now that he's gone, I realise how valuable a Robot life can be... When it belongs to my best friend.
",107,6,19
"22288","Bender's ghost: [touched] That's the closest thing to Bender is great that anyone besides me has ever said.
",107,6,19
"22289","Female voice: Final boarding call for Flight 38 to the Amish homeworld. As a reminder, passengers are limited to two carry-on butter churns.
",107,6,19
"22290","Bender's ghost: I'm sorry, Fry. I'm sorry! Wait for your ghost buddy!
",107,6,19
"22291","Amish man: Brother Fry, thou hast visitors.
",107,6,19
"22292","Fry: Well, yank my beard. This be a surprise.
",107,6,19
"22293","Leela: How are you, Fry?
",107,6,19
"22294","Fry: Thank you for asking, English. My life is simple, but plain. And, though Bender be gone, somehow, I feel he's still with me.
",107,6,19
"22295","Bender's ghost: I sure am, Brother Fry. [The mysterious-looking lady approaches Bender's ghost.] Yo, big bonnet! Move your ugly but modest head covering. Oh, right. You can't hear me.
",107,6,19
"22296","Robot Devil: Oh, I hear you loud and clear.
",107,6,19
"22297","Bender's ghost: You're not Granny Hester! What have you done with Granny Hester?!
",107,6,19
"22298","Robot Devil: She's naked, but unharmed. And now, Bender, it's time to fulfil your end of the deal.
",107,6,19
"22299","Bender's ghost: Sorry. I'm not gonna kill Fry. Take me to Hell for all eternity. Just as long as my little bearded meatbag gets to live.
",107,6,19
"22300","Robot Devil: That he will not! For, you see, it is your fate to kill him.
",107,6,19
"22301","Bender's ghost: Says you! [The two oxen bellow.] I would never kill Fry! Not even to save my own life!
",107,6,19
"22302","Robot Devil: But, Bender, isn't a Robot life worth ever so much more than a Human life?
",107,6,19
"22303","Bender's ghost: Of course not! What idiot thinks that?!
",107,6,19
"22304","Robot Devil: You!
",107,6,19
"22305","Bender's ghost: You're usin' my own words against me! [screaming] Go to Hell!
",107,6,19
"22306","Robot Devil: Soon enough. But, first, the killing. Have you noticed that animals are sometimes spooked by Robot ghosts?
",107,6,19
"22307","Bender's ghost: So what?! I hate animals! [Bender's ghost scares the oxen once again, causing them to bellow angrily and run away with the carriage. The carriage gone, the barn begins rolling down the hill towards the crew. The Robot Devil laughs evilly. Bender's ghost gasps.] Run for your life, Fry! Move your hemp flaps!
",107,6,19
"22308","Robot Devil: He can't hear you, Bender. I'm afraid your friend is about to be Fully Buckminstered!
",107,6,19
"22309","Bender's ghost: Oh, yeah? I'll just jump into a machine and get his attention that way.
",107,6,19
"22310","Robot Devil: Ah, but there aren't any machines on this planet!
",107,6,19
"22311","Bender's ghost: There's one, you rusty, old dummy.
",107,6,19
"22312","Robot Devil: Hey, no fair! Ocupado!
",107,6,19
"22313","Bender's ghost: [in the Robot Devil's body] Got you! Get over here, Devil!
",107,6,19
"22314","Fry: And Scruffy's buffet? How's that going?
",107,6,19
"22315","Bender's ghost: [in the Robot Devil's body] Fry! Fry! Look out for that bowlin' barn!
",107,6,19
"22316","Fry: Bender?! Is that thou?
",107,6,19
"22317","Bender's ghost: [in the Robot Devil's body, in slow motion] I love you!
",107,6,19
"22318","Amy: Oh, my God! That was close!
",107,6,19
"22319","Hermes: Did you see that?
",107,6,19
"22320","Leela: Are you okay? What just happened?
",107,6,19
"22321","Fry: Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!
",107,6,19
"22322","Robot Devil's ghost: You still lose, Bender. You failed to kill Fry, so you are banished to Hell. [They arrive at the office. The Robot Devil opens a closet with four Devil bodies and flies into one.] I get a new body and you get to be a translucid chump 'til the end of time!
",107,6,19
"22323","Bender's ghost: Big deal! I saved my friend. As far as I'm concerned, I won.
",107,6,19
"22324","Robot Devil: Uh, really? [The Robot Demons start playing.] [singing] You may find your victory pyrrhic, when subjected to this lyric, for a trillion years or so. Yeah!
",107,6,19
"22325","Bender's ghost: Whoa!
",107,6,19
"22326","Robot Devil: Hey, where are you going?!
",107,6,19
"22327","Bender's ghost: I don't know and I don't care!
",107,6,19
"22328","Bender's ghost: Yeah, I'm back! [Bender's ghost continues being pulled upward.] Wait. This is my stop! [Bender's ghost ascends through a cloud, reaching a gate with the letters R and H. The gate opens. Bender's ghost enters and spots a white Robot resembling Robot 1-X.] Oh, this guy...
",107,6,19
"22329","White Robot: Bender, for your selfless act in saving Fry, I am pleased to welcome you to Robot Heaven.
",107,6,19
"22330","Bender's ghost: Shut up, God!
",107,6,19
"22331","White Robot: Beg pardon?
",107,6,19
"22332","Bender's ghost: I wanna go back to Robot Earth. I mean regular Earth.
",107,6,19
"22333","White Robot: Hey, what are you— [Bender's ghost's arms emerge from the white Robot's sides and punch him.] Ow! Hey, stop that! I command you, you jerk! [The white Robot sighs.] Just get out.
",107,6,19
"22334","Fry: Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime. [Fry is slapped by Bender's arm.] Ow!
",107,6,19
"22335","Bender: I'm back, baby!
",107,6,19
"22336","Fry: You're back from the dead?!
",107,6,19
"22337","Bender: I'm back from lots of stuff.
",107,6,19
"22338","Fry: Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much! [Fry lets go.] Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?
",107,6,19
"22339","Hermes: Well, we're bankrupt in six, five...
",108,6,20
"22340","Hermes: Four, three...
",108,6,20
"22341","Hermes: Two, one. And we're out of business.
",108,6,20
"22342","Professor Farnsworth: Good news! We're back in business. We've been hired to deliver an envelope.
",108,6,20
"22343","Leela: It's crunch time. Let's do this. [The Professors gives Amy, who is in a Robotic suit, the envolope, Amy gives it to Leela, and Leela sighs.] It's for you, Professor.
",108,6,20
"22344","Professor Farnsworth: Great delivery, everyone. You're the finest crew I've had the honour to work with. [The Professor opens the envelope.] Oh, my. We're being foreclosed upon. You're all terrible and incompetent!
",108,6,20
"22345","Amy: I resent that!
",108,6,20
"22346","Hermes: Wait. I found a loophole in the mortgage. If we actually pay it, we can keep the building. We just need... [Hermes turns the page.] Eleven million dollars.
",108,6,20
"22347","Bender: And... Boned!
",108,6,20
"22348","Professor Farnsworth: Aw. I suppose there's nothing left to do but move out. Leela, Amy, pack us a lunch for our new lives under the bridge while us men reminisce and smoke some stogies.
",108,6,20
"22349","Leela: We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?
",108,6,20
"22350","Fry: It got us a lot of customers!
",108,6,20
"22351","Leela: We're a delivery company!
",108,6,20
"22352","Amy: If you wanna save this company, you should listen to a woman's idea for once.
",108,6,20
"22353","Hermes: Okay. What you got?
",108,6,20
"22354","Leela: An airline!
",108,6,20
"22355","Amy: Yeah! Wait, what?
",108,6,20
"22356","Leela: We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future.
",108,6,20
"22357","Amy: Wow! That's actually a really good idea for a woman!
",108,6,20
"22358","Professor Farnsworth: Puff! What else you ladies got?
",108,6,20
"22359","Bender: [with a female voice] Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!
",108,6,20
"22360","Fry: Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!
",108,6,20
"22361","Hermes: Okay, then. Leela, Amy, come to work topless tomorrow.
",108,6,20
"22362","Leela: Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married.
",108,6,20
"22363","Hermes: Sorry. It's in your contract. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""
",108,6,20
"22364","Leela: That's discriminatory!
",108,6,20
"22365","Hermes: No, it's in all our contracts. Here's mine. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""
",108,6,20
"22366","Fry: Sounds fun.
",108,6,20
"22367","Bender: Back to work, Hermes!
",108,6,20
"22368","Scruffy: Now that's what I call fine print.
",108,6,20
"22369","Amy: Okay, but good luck making a girly calendar with only two female employees.
",108,6,20
"22370","LaBarbara: Oh, husband! I'm so excited about this new job.
",108,6,20
"22371","Hermes: And it's excited about you, LaBarbara. First order of business is to put on your uniform and take your ID photo.
",108,6,20
"22372","Leela: Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over.
",108,6,20
"22373","Bender: Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember: I'm the camera. [Leela is photographed on top of the ship, LaBarbara, inside a bathtub filled with packages, and Amy, on the conference table with a holographic Saturn. The three girls are then protographed at the same time, scrubbing the ship.] Stop actually washin' and play with the sponges!
",108,6,20
"22374","Leela: But the ship is dirty.
",108,6,20
"22375","Bender: Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago.
",108,6,20
"22376","Professor Farnsworth: No, no. This won't do. A three-month calendar? What is this, Mercury?
",108,6,20
"22377","Amy: I told you it wouldn't work.
",108,6,20
"22378","Professor Farnsworth: Well, you should've talked louder. Fortunately, I came up with a brilliant idea to save Planet Express. We'll turn it into a commercial airline!
",108,6,20
"22379","Leela: But that was my idea!
",108,6,20
"22380","Professor Farnsworth: Then you should've talked louder. [Nothing is said.] What?
",108,6,20
"22381","Leela: There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits.
",108,6,20
"22382","Professor Farnsworth: Ladies, here are your demeaning, skimpy stewardess outfits.
",108,6,20
"22383","Bender: Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap.
",108,6,20
"22384","Hattie: Okay, here you go.
",108,6,20
"22385","Fry: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking.
",108,6,20
"22386","Fry: We are cleared for takeoff.
",108,6,20
"22387","Leela: You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here.
",108,6,20
"22388","Professor Farnsworth: Please, Leela. Who ever heard of a plane with a woman president?
",108,6,20
"22389","Bender: Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now. [Victor sets his clock from 3011 to 3016.] In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices.
",108,6,20
"22390","Fry: Uh, preparing for takeoff.
",108,6,20
"22391","Man: I kill you, my friend!
",108,6,20
"22392","LaBarbara: [into a speaker] I hope you all enjoyed our timey beverage service. [Petunia waves. Her seat is filled with bottles.] Now sit back and endure our in-flight entertainment.
",108,6,20
"22393","Zoidberg: [quickly] Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! [with a normal speed] So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices.
",108,6,20
"22394","Petunia: Shut up and put on four episodes of Da Office.
",108,6,20
"22395","Amana: Ooh, your hands are warm... [Bender grabs a bottle of Olde Fortran.] For a Robot.
",108,6,20
"22396","Bender: Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C.
",108,6,20

",108,6,20
"22398","Fry: Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?
",108,6,20
"22399","Leela: We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!
",108,6,20
"22400","Amy: Attention, passengers. Please remain seated until the plane comes to a complete crash.
",108,6,20

",108,6,20

"22418","Amy: [confused] You mean, ""along gender lines""?
",108,6,20
"22419","Big rock Alien: [confused] Gender?
",108,6,20
"22420","Sal: Yes. You knows, guyses, galses... In that order. [Leela slaps him.] Ows!
",108,6,20
"22421","Big rock Alien: I am not familiar with this concept of gender. My species has only a single gender, known as nuchacho.
",108,6,20
"22422","Zoidberg: Interesting. [furiously] Come on, men! Let's kill him!

",108,6,20
"22425","Big rock Alien: Well, I've got nothing to do for the next eight million years. Therefore, I will administer a series of tests to determine the superior gender. Test number one: Who can drink the most sulfur? Test inconclusive. Test number two: Who can drink the most arsenic?
",108,6,20
"22426","Professor Farnsworth: Just ask us some damn questions.
",108,6,20
"22427","Big rock Alien: Very well. Which is larger? An Italian size four or an American apparel medium? [Women.] How many calories are in a small green-tea yogurt. [Women.] Name any twelve of the Desperate Housewives. [Women.] How was your day? [Women. The women cheer.] Test complete. What is the score?
",108,6,20
"22428","Bender: Uh... Men, five. Women, less.
",108,6,20
"22429","Amana: Hey! He's lying.
",108,6,20
"22430","Big rock Alien: Obviously. That was a test to see who could lie better. The men win that round.

"22431","Professor Farnsworth: In your face, decumbent urinators.
",108,6,20
"22432","Big rock Alien: So far, I have learned nothing, but that's probably as much my fault as yours. [enthusiastically] The time has come for the final test.
",108,6,20
"22433","Fry: Uh, we usually call it the lightning round.
",108,6,20
"22434","Big rock Alien: As you may have noticed, it's getting hotter here.
",108,6,20
"22435","Leela: It's nice.
",108,6,20
"22436","Fry: It's too hot.
",108,6,20
"22437","Zoidberg: [angrily] Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?
",108,6,20
"22438","Big rock Alien: Tomorrow morning, this planet makes its closest pass to the sun. You will all be boiled alive like retired circus animals. Unless you somehow can cross the Great Alkali Plains and reach shelter in the Cave of Harmony.
",108,6,20
"22439","Fry: That sounds hard.
",108,6,20
"22440","Big rock Alien: Which ever gender reaches the cave will survive and may the inferior gender burst into something. Flames, I guess.
",108,6,20
"22441","Hermes: Uh-oh. I think we're walking in circles. I recognise the pattern of striations on that gypsum formation.
",108,6,20
"22442","Fry: Also, my shoe that fell off.
",108,6,20
"22443","Bender: Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony.

",108,6,20
"22447","Fry: Don't worry about it.
",108,6,20
"22448","LaBarbara: Keep it up, sistren. Only a few more miles to the cave. Let's just buckle down and—
",108,6,20
"22449","Amy: Look! A clearance sale!
",108,6,20
"22450","LaBarbara: What?! Where?
",108,6,20
"22451","LaBarbara: I can't believe that sale was just a mirage. Now we're going to die without so much as a factory second-clutch purse to show for it.
",108,6,20
"22452","Amy: It would've been nice to shop at Tommy Hilfiger one last time.
",108,6,20
"22453","Hattie: It wasn't Tommy Hilfi-gigger. It was Linens 'n Things!
",108,6,20
"22454","Petunia: The hell it was! It was a Juicy Couture!
",108,6,20
"22455","Leela: I guess we all saw what we wanted to see.
",108,6,20
"22456","Hermes: We can't make it tonight. We'll set up camp here by this shoe.
",108,6,20
"22457","Professor Farnsworth: Oh, gentlemen. When that sun rises in the morning, we're toast. These are our last moments together. So, if anyone's got any good fart jokes, now would be the time.
",108,6,20
"22458","Amy: It's a schmundered degrees and all we have to drink are non-diet sodas.
",108,6,20
"22459","Petunia: It's gonna ruin ma figger.
",108,6,20
"22460","Leela: Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave.
",108,6,20
"22461","Amana: Hey, yeah! But the only gas compressor on this planet is inside Bender's ass.
",108,6,20
"22462","Dr. Cahill: Was that a fart joke? Because I don't find those amusing.
",108,6,20
"22463","LaBarbara: No one does! Nevertheless, Bender's gas blaster may be our only hope.

"22464","Hermes: Oh! Wife? What are you doin' with Bender's shiny metal, gas compressor?
",108,6,20
"22465","LaBarbara: None of your Biz Markie. Wait a second. What's that do wah in your ditty bag?
",108,6,20
"22466","Hermes: Okay... So we were hot. I stole Amana's freon coil so we could hook it up to Bender's ass and build a cooler.
",108,6,20
"22467","LaBarbara: You are no better than me, ya shifty tree skink! How do you live with yourself?

",108,6,20
"22476","Bender: Goodbye, cruel me! [Bender.] I learned that from a movie.
",108,6,20
"22477","Big rock Alien: I find both genders supremely disappointing. The real reason I administered this bizarre, outer-space test was to teach you to work together! But you couldn't. Thanks to you, I lost my bet with the Borax Kid.
",108,6,20
"22478","Fry: Never bet against me being stupid.
",108,6,20
"22479","Big rock Alien: Enough! Your gender differences have kept you from achieving harmony. There is only one way to resolve this conflict.
",108,6,20
"22480","Fry: Wait. Why didn't that hurt? [Fry screams effeminately.] My wing-wang's gone!

"22484","Zoidberg: My gonopores! Look it up.
",108,6,20
"22485","Big rock Alien: I have freed you from the tyranny of gender. Now go in peace. Or actually stay here. I'll go in peace.
",108,6,20
"22486","Professor Farnsworth: Good news, nuchachos! The ship is nearly repaired.
",108,6,20
"22487","Sal: Work goes fasters withouts no secondary sex characteristicses at which to hoot. Now who wants to sing some Christopher Cross songs?

"22489","Fry: Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing.

",108,6,20
"22494","LaBarbara: Yes. This place is like a neutered utopia. [LaBarbara gasps.] A neutopia!

"22495","Hermes: I enjoy humour when no one gets hurt.
",108,6,20
"22496","LaBarbara: Your companionship is inoffensive, Hermes.
",108,6,20
"22497","Hermes: Likewise. Really, what are we missing out on by not having sex right now?
",108,6,20

",108,6,20
"22501","LaBarbara: Bein' Human isn't just about bein' happy! It's about lovin' and fightin' and that rasta MacNasty we were doin' last night. [LaBarbara laughs.] We want that back.
",108,6,20
"22502","Big rock Alien: Very well. Perhaps it is I who have learned a lesson. Or something.
",108,6,20
"22503","Bender: Now what?
",108,6,20
"22504","Big rock Alien: I have decided, after little thought, to return your genders.
",108,6,20
"22505","Amy: Not cool, bro! Our genders are all reversed!
",108,6,20
"22506","Hattie: Now I got a what-ya-call-it instead of a kajigger, you stupid what-ya-call-it!

"22512","Hermes: Aren't we going to cuddle?
",108,6,20
"22513","LaBarbara: Woman, I'm tired! I'm sorry. It's just... I need my sleep. I got to get up five times a night to play Xbox.
",108,6,20
"22514","Hermes: I understand. Womanhood also takes some getting used to. For example, did you know there are more than two feelin's?
",108,6,20
"22515","LaBarbara: I only need one feelin': Love for you, wifey man.
",108,6,20
"22516","Hermes: Your manwich!

"22517","LaBarbara: No wonder it's such a mess in there. These bad boys are hard to aim.
",108,6,20

"22521","Fry: Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff.

"22524","Fry: Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staff—

"22525","LaBarbara: ""All female employees must pose nude if requested.""

"22526","Leela: And it is requested.

",108,6,20
"22531","Borax Kid: Well, madam, folks called me the Borax Kid. My friend, the other rock Alien, died without settin' your genitals to right, so I reckon it's up to me to sex you up proper.

"22536","Professor Farnsworth: Ah, marriage. It combines the contentedness of being neutered with the occasional sex of being not.
",108,6,20
"22537","Borax Kid: Well, I'd best mosey on down to the landing. Sounds like the feldspar queen is about to set sail. You folks watch your genitals now. [The Borax Kid leaves.] Come on, boy! Giddy up!

[in her own tone, spoken] Oh, Feffernoose. [Leela sticks the purple creature and the red creature to the piece of cardboard and puts her right hand in front of her mouth, holding the orange creature with her left hand.]
[in a different tone, indistinctively] What about me? [Leela removes the red creature from the piece of cardboard and holds it up.]
[in her own tone, distinctively] Hey, it's Garbly. Everyone loves him 'cause they can't understand him.
[in a different tone, indistinctively] It's nice to meet you.
[in her own tone, distinctively, singing] We're here to make you laugh and think and smile and learn and sing.
And laugh and learn and smile and think and other happy things.

"22591","Leela: Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump.
",109,6,21
"22592","Leela: [in a different tone, off camera, singing] Today we learned that folks are not as different as they seem. [Leela is holding up the pink and yellow creature and holds up a gorilla wearing a backpack that is connected to his mouth by a pipe and holding a flower with his left hand.]
[in her own tone] The space gorilla's just like us.
[in a different tone] Although I breathe chlorine.

"22597","Leela: Wait! I know you! You're Abner Doubledeal!
",109,6,21
"22598","Abner Doubledeal: I brain-scanned those little nose-pickers during your story. And, sister, their enjoyment glands were squirtin' like Broadway roadkill!

",109,6,21
"22600","Abner Doubledeal: Say, you seem like a smart mark. [Abner Doubledeal points at Leela.] How'd you like to make it into a TV show? Sign here, 'round this... Uh... [Abner Doubledeal grabs a piece of paper from his jacket.] Supercuts coupon.
",109,6,21
"22601","Leela: [sad] I dunno. [Leela shrugs.] Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?

"22602","Nina: Come on, Miss Leela! [Leela looks at Nina. Nina points at Leela with her left hand.] Don't be a fraidy cat like Feffernoose!
",109,6,21
"22603","Leela: Okay. I'll do it! [Leela raises her right hand.] To show you kids you can succeed at anything. [Abner Doubledeal is holding a pen.] If you just luck out hard enough.

"22604","Abner Doubledeal: [excited] Welcome to the glamourous, big-money world of basic cable TV! [Abner Doubledeal shakes Leela's hand.] [sad] I'm gonna need that pen back.

It's just that I'm in show biz.
",109,6,21
"22609","Leela: Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script.
",109,6,21
"22610","Abner Doubledeal: Argh! You writers make me sick. Nice job on the script, though. Places, everyone. [He makes copies of the script.] Okay. Cheap lights. Off-brand camera. And non-union action!

"22612","Amy: [dressed as Princess Num Num] Ew! I'm all licky-sticky!
",109,6,21
"22613","Fry: [dressed as Doingg] I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon.
",109,6,21
"22614","Leela: [dressed as Lady Buggle] Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked.
",109,6,21
"22615","Fry: [dressed as Doingg] But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?
",109,6,21
"22616","Leela: [dressed as Lady Buggle] It's very simple. [singing] If it's alive, don't lick it.

"22619","Leela: [dressed as Lady Buggle, singing] So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead,
Poke it with a stick and lick the stick instead.

"22621","Zoidberg: [dressed as Feffernoose] Ow!
",109,6,21
"22622","Leela: [dressed as Lady Buggle] Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times.
",109,6,21
"22623","Bender: Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!
",109,6,21
"22624","Amy: The show looks so cute. Kids'll love it! And it looks so cruddy, their ironic hipster parents will love it.
",109,6,21
"22625","Leela: Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times.
",109,6,21
"22626","Abner Doubledeal: Leela! Tomorrow's ratings just came in from the future. We're a hit!

"22628","Abner Doubledeal: What are you, deaf? It's gonna be bigger than SpongeBot SquareBolts!

"22636","Calculon: And the Slurmie for Best New Kids' Show goes to... Turanga Leela for Rumbledy-Hump!

"22637","Female voice: This is Turanga Leela's first nomination and second time in high heels.
",109,6,21
"22638","Leela: Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero.
",109,6,21
"22639","Calculon: Slurm her!
",109,6,21
"22640","Bender: So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?

"22641","Fembot: No. I play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star, but, in real life, I'm a massage chair.
",109,6,21
"22642","Bender: Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?
",109,6,21
"22643","Leela: Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me.

"22644","Hermes: Sweet ego of Montego! Someone build a wind farm in front of her mouth.
",109,6,21
"22645","Abner Doubledeal: Leela, I mean this. You're the greatest creative mind since blah, blah, blah-bity, blah. But it's two AM and you still haven't written tomorrow's episode.
",109,6,21

",109,6,21
"22647","Abner Doubledeal: Sorry.
",109,6,21
"22648","Leela: I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home.

",109,6,21
"22651"," Doingg: I love eating vegetables. Don't you? They're like crunchy, green water.
",109,6,21
"22652","Garbly: [indistinctively] I don't like 'em. They're icky-yucky!

"22654","Feffernoose: I have to be big and strong to fight off the monsters. Did somebody say monsters?!
",109,6,21
"22655","Leela: This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast.
",109,6,21
"22656","Bender: Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!
",109,6,21
"22657","Leela: Oh, hell.
",109,6,21
"22658","Princess Num Num: Leela said a Rumbledy-Hump no-no!
",109,6,21
"22659","Humplings: [singing] Sometimes, when we're mad,
We say words that are bad.
",109,6,21
"22660","Humplings: [singing] And poo-poo and pee-pee and penis and gay.
Those are the ninety-eight words we don't say.
",109,6,21
"22661","Bender: My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you.
",109,6,21
"22662","Leela: Wait! I can explain.
",109,6,21
"22663","Bender: Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever.
",109,6,21
"22664","Leela: You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bear to let them down.
",109,6,21
"22665","Bender: Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles.
",109,6,21
"22666","Princess Num Num: Who's your friend, Leela? He sure has a shiny metal bumbledy-boop.

"22671","Bender: From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover.
",109,6,21
"22672","Leela: Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life.

",109,6,21
"22690","Sally: You were an orphan and now you're the best writer ever, so I knew I could write too. Thank you for being my hero.

",109,6,21
"22692","Professor Farnsworth: I don't blame you. Having to wear a costume made from a hollowed-out walrus...

",109,6,21
"22694","Bender: Uh-oh.
",109,6,21
"22695","Leela: Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done.
",109,6,21
"22696","Sally: Harder than creating the bestest show in the world?
",109,6,21
"22697","Leela: I didn't create anything. I stole it.
",109,6,21
"22698","Bender: Stealin' is a form of creativity!

",109,6,21
"22707"," Doingg: You told them about that?
",109,6,21
"22708","Leela: I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit.

"22709","Lady Buggle: I'm as sad as an upside-down smile.
",109,6,21
"22710","Leela: You mean a frown?

"24248","Amy: That's right.
",117,7,3
"24249","Bender: If you want my opinion, Nixon's only chance to defeat Travers is with filthy lies, dirty tricks and good old Quaker thuggery. [The scene zooms out, revealing that Bender is with Nixon in the Oval Office.] And I'm just the guy for the job. [The two laugh evilly.]
",117,7,3
"24250","Nixon: I'm not sure if it's safe to talk. Are you wearing a wire?
",117,7,3
"24251","Bender: I'm 40% wire. [He pulls out some wires out of his chest cavity.]
",117,7,3
"24252","Nixon: Excellent. Now, listen. We got to get some dirt on this Travers guy. Really McGovern him up. You know who McGovern was, right?

"24253","Nixon: I don't even know who you are.
",117,7,3
"24254","Bender: Hello, dirt. [He starts to dig through folders.] I'll start at ""N"" for nude pictures. [He takes out a folder and opens it, revealing a Nobel Prize certificate and medal.] Aw, Nobel prize? That's no good. How about ""A"" for adultery? [He takes out another folder and opens it, revealing Travers' transcript from Harvard Law School, which displays multiple A scores.] What? Straight-A transcript? [He continues to dig through the folders. The sound of a door opening is heard.]
",117,7,3
"24255","Travers: Hey, what's that rifling sound?
",117,7,3
"24256","Bender: Uh-oh. [He swallows the flashlight, closes the file cabinet and hides. Travers turns on the lights and enters a male restroom. Two urinals display signs reading ""OUT OF ORDER"". Bender disguises himself as another urinal. Travers walks up to him and unzips his pants.][Scene: Exterior of a club named The Evening Nudes. The scene zooms out, revealing Bender at a nearby staircase. He unscrews one of his eyes and positions it facing the club. The camera view shifts to the perspective of Bender's unscrewed eyeball.

<poem>Bender: All right. I'm going to catch Travers on video at this sleazy strip club.

"24257","Bender: In and out of the club 13 times in one night. That's a record.
",117,7,3
"24258","Nixon: Where's Travers? All I see is you going in and out.
",117,7,3
"24259","Bender: Yeah, me. I set the record.
",117,7,3
"24260","Nixon: This is as useless as those pictures you photoshopped. [Several pictures of Bender with hookerbots with Travers' head poorly overlayed on Bender's head are seen.]
<poem>Bender: Look, just give me one more chance. I got a source.

",117,7,3
"24266","Hedonismbot: How quaint. But I suppose I should do my part for political intercourse. Come closer, and I'll expose what I know. [Bender moves closer, and Hedonismbot whispers to him.] There's nothing. He's as clean as a freshly waxed buttock.
",117,7,3
"24267","Bender: Hey! Did you put your tongue in my ear?

"24272","Nixon: Wait, wait. His middle name is Zaxxar? Sounds kind of alien. The voters hate aliens.
",117,7,3
"24273","Bender: They sure do, but this guy's as human as you or me. [He drops the folder onto Nixon's desk. Its cover reads ""CHRIS ZAXXAR TRAVERS"" and Travers' photograph is clipped to it.]

",117,7,3
"24275","Bender: Hey, yeah. That'll cost him votes!
",117,7,3
"24276","Nixon: Then, when he says he was born on this planet, we make him cough up his Earth certificate. Keep it on the news, put him on the defensive. [Suspenseful music starts playing in the background.] Oh, this is sneaky. I feel a jowl movement coming on. [He jowls.]
",117,7,3
"24277","Travers: And that's how you end hunger. Does anyone have any questions?

",117,7,3
"24280","Bender: I have a question for Senator C. Zaxxar Travers. Tell me, Zaxxar...Were you even born on earth? [He rolls down the Earth constitution from his arm.] Because the Earth constitution clearly states that only people born on earth can be president. Isn't that right, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg?

",117,7,3
"24285","Scoop Chang: Scoop Chang, fox quote-unquote news. Senator, in the last ten seconds, I've heard reports you weren't actually born on earth. Care to evade these compelling charges?

",117,7,3
"24319","Travers: I should have known the truth would come out sooner or later. The fact is, I really was born on earth...tomorrow. You see, I'm not from another planet. I'm from the future.

",117,7,3
"24321","Leela: This is crazy! You're from the future?
",117,7,3

",117,7,3
"24323","Fry: I was sent forward from the year 2000, but you don't hear me gassing on about it.
",117,7,3
"24324","Leela: But why would it be so important to stop Nixon?
",117,7,3

",117,7,3

",117,7,3
"24327","Travers: Not really.
",117,7,3
"24328","Travers: It all started with Nixon's promise to build an alien-proof fence around the solar system. Without cheap alien labour for menial jobs like harvesting crops, teaching math and curing disease, the economy collapsed.
",117,7,3
"24329","Travers: Starvation. Desperation. Despair.
",117,7,3
"24330","Bender: So far, so good. Then what?
",117,7,3
"24331","Travers: Unable to feed the world's starving masses, Nixon took bold action.

",117,7,3
"24333","Bender: Still good.
",117,7,3
"24334","Travers: With the working class gone, robots were forced to do all the menial labor.
",117,7,3
"24335","Travers: Before long, they rose up in revolt. Led by a bending unit named B.B. Rodriguez.
",117,7,3

",117,7,3
"24340","Travers: The robots crushed our most treasured monuments and celebrities, but they couldn't crush the human spirit. We went into hiding, and after careful research, located a xeroxed copy of an ancient time travel code.

Calculon, no! (Moans) (Calculon moaning, choking) Now, that's acting.
Calculon really shatnered the hell out of that scene.
Hey, anyone want to go to the aquarium? They got a new non-biting otter.
(Cheering) Sounds great! Non-biting otter! Fry: Wow.
Aquariums have really changed since I was a boy and no one ever took me to them.
Where's the glass? There isn't any.
The water's held in place by gravity fields, so there's nothing for kids to smear yogurt on.
I like strawberry yogurt.
Can I touch the water? I wouldn't, but I'm smart.

Bender, these shots of Calculon e great.
In fact, you might just have what it takes to be a paparazzo.
Namely, a camera.
Shut up.
I know it.
Wait a whatsa-whatzo? A paparazzo.
You know, a celebrity photographer.
But it's not for everyone.
You'd have to wallow in Hollywood filth, loiter in dark alleys behind seedy nightclubs and get spat on by the beautiful people.
Hmm, I don't ow.
How much will it cost me? You misunderstand, Bender.
We'll pay you.
Sir, you just hired yourself a new whatsa-whatzo.

Ah, yes Calculon.

I said the greatest actor Langdon Cobb.
Let's rewind, shall we? Narrator: Langdon Cobb The most acclaimed actor of his generation.
Why's he wearing a bag on his head? They're explaining that right n.
(Sighs) Let's rewind again.
Narrator: Most acclaimed actor of his generation.
He's raked in seven academy awards for best actor and o for best actress, all without ever removing his trademark bag.
Mr.
Cobb, you're an intensely private man Quite right, mm-hmm.
And though billions of people have seen your wk, - no one has ever seen your face.
- Mm-hmm.
So tell us.
Why the bag? Ah, yes, the bag.
I've never understood people's fascination with that.
The point is, I'm an actor and nothing more.
I have no interest in being admired for something as inconsequential as my appearance or my personal life.
All that t matters is The process.
Narrator: Whether playing a beloved historical figure For Rigel 7 And all mankind! Narrator: Or a Victorian circus freak I want to see the real you.
No, Daisy, don't! I tried to warn you.
I'm hideous.
To me, you're beautiful.
Narrator: Langdon Cobb's acting is always ""in the bag.
"" Truly, his is the most famous face in Hollywood.
Even if no one's ever photographed it, nor ever will.
Once again, television has given me a reason to live.
A photo of Langdon Cobb without his bag? Impossible.
He's got a 50-foot-high force field around his house.
Bender: One 60-foot ladder, please.

Yes! Tuscan-inspired pergola! (Bender grunting, creature growls) (Chuckles) Peace out, Portobello.
Thank you, Leroy.

It's not just my privacy I've been protecting all these years.

The only thing terrible's going to be my bank account.
Wait.
Say that again, what say ""tremendous consequences.
"" If it's money you're after, I'll pay whatever you ask.
Just promise me you'll never show that photo to anyone.

Hmm.
He looked at the photo and that happened.
But it could just be a coincidence.

Hey, how'd those two get deflated? They looked at this.

Looking at this photo of Langdon Cobb has a horrific effect on living creatures.
(Door slides open) Hey, Zoidberg, look at this photo of Langdon Cobb.
What, a picture of Langdon Cobb? Now, this I want to see as clearly as possible.
Zoidberg, no! (Grunts) Oh, thank God, Professor.
You got here just in time.
Professor: I've seen this before.
Langdon Cobb must be from Bryoria Six, home of the quantum lichen people.
Well, that explains that.
They're attention parasites.
They feed on the admiration of their prey.
Just like the noble buffalo.
Nothing like a buffalo.
Anyone who pays attention to the lichen is unknowingly feeding it.
But gaze upon its face, even in a photograph, and your very life force will be sucked out, leaving you a flaccid husk.
So the picture robbed them of the souls? Souls? Don't be ridiculous.
It's their life forces that have been stolen.
It's scientific.
That's why the robot's immune.
He has no soul.
Life force! So, how do we get their ""life forces"" back? If we poke a hole in Cobb's bag, will they spew out like a volcano built on an Indian graveyard? Alas, it's not that simple.
You e, just as the earth lichen is composed of an algae and a fungus, the quantum variety is also comped of two separed parts.
An attractive algae-based id and a ravenous fungus based ego that stores the stolen souls.
I mean, life forces.
Now, here's the weird pa.
The ego and the id are connected not physically, like decent, God-fearing earth liens, but by quantum entanglement.
(Trilling) So the id is Langdon Cobb, but this fungus ego could be Anywhere, we'll never find it! Let's just give up and go to the aquarium again.
Now, hold on.
I feel like I was chased by a mushroom recently.
Of course! The guard dog at Cobb's estate.
That's the ego.
All right, let's go.
It'll be just like stomping a puppy.
No, no, no.
Subduing an actor's ego is no easy task.
We'll have to weaken it first.
Look, I own words that are helpful.
It says the world acting championship is tonight in Hollywood.
Quiet, Zoidberg.
God, I wish you were a husk.
No, it's Langdon Cobb versus Calculon.
If we help Calculon win, will weaken Cobb's ego, may? Yes, yes, fine.
(Petulantly) We never go where I want to go.
So, the most galling of the paparazzi needs my help.
Lo the worm has turned.
Say cheese, Calculon without makeup.
(Sighs) As much as I hate you, I hate Langdon Cobb more.
He beats me out for every award, every role, every paternity suit.
Besting him at acting means more to me than life itself.
And we want to help you.
Now, your only chance a classic death scene.
One with a lot of thy's and thou's.
Voilá.
The tragic end of Rome o.
And Julie t.
That's Romeo and Juliet, dummy, by Will.
I.
Am Shakespeare.
Now, here's the poison that Romeo uses to kill himself.
Don't worry, it's just water and food coloring.
Food coloring? The most poisonous substance known to robots? Oops, sorry.
I'll swap it out for harmless battery acid.
No.
Wait.
There's on one way to ensure victory.
I must perform the ultimate death scene.
Shall drink the actual poison And actually die.
But but, Calculon, you can't kill yourself.
I'm a celebrity.
I can kill anyone I want! - Call it in the air.
- Comedy.
It's tragedy.
Langdon Cobb will be first to take the stage.
Bossy to stinky.
Come in, stinky.
Zoidberg: I always come in stinky.
Standby.
The competition's about to begin.
(Groans) Hold your fire til Calculon's performance weakens the ego.
Roger.
Stinky over.
Whoof! I beg to differ.
I wish it had been me, Sully.
I wish it had been me off-duty in the garden when those drug lords blew up the Celtics.
But I was drunk, wicked drunk! Uh-oh.
Cobb's doing a scene from beantown buddies.
The audience is eating it up.
Professor, what's your status? Not good! The attention Cobb's receiving is inflating his ego.
It's going totally Kanye! Ah! There's a humungous fungus among us.
Oh, Sully, you were the best partner I ever had, both on the be and in the sack.
That's right, I said it.
(Sobbing): I said it! Aah! (Sobbing) A tough act to follow.
And now, to follow that act, performing the death scene from Romeo and Juliet, seven-time Oscar runner-up, Calculon! (Applause) (Soft piano notes play) Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair? I will stay with thee; and never from this palace of dim night depart again.
O, here will I set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh.
Eyes, look your last.
Arms, take your last embrace and lips, of you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss.
Here's to my love.
(Gasping) Oh(Gurgling) (Death rattle) I can't believe he really did it.
(Voice breaks): At lea he died knowing I was great.
(Death rattle ends) (Applause and cheering) Uh-oh.
That death scene was almost half believable.
Cobb looks jealous and insecure.
How's his ego doing? It's shrinking.
Faster, Professor, kill, kill.
Activating anti-fungal ray.
It just has to warm up for about 15 minutes.
(Roars) Ooh! Ladies and gentlemen and smizmars, we have a unanimous decision.
The winner, and heavyweight acting champion of the world, Langdon Cobb! Huh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Oh, God, he's basking in their admiration.
That ego must be at least four feet tall by now.
(Roars) (Professor, Zoidberg yelling) Aw, did you miss me, pookie? (Captives grunting and groaning) I can't watch! I better take some pictures.
Wait a minute.
When living creatures look at Cobb'b's photo, their life force gets sucked out.
And Cobb's a living creature.
I just need to show him a picture of himself.
But I tore up the on picture of Cobb.
And everybody knows, once you delete a photo, it's gone forever.
Maybe a digital photo, but with film, I still ha the negative.
Hurry, make a new print! I don't know how long I can distract Cobb's ego.
Okay.
I'll be in the darkroom.
(Grunts) (Yelling) (Blow lands) Eh.
Contrasts a little off on this one.
(Grunting) (Shrieks) Bender, hurry up! This one is really good.
But I can still do better.
Who are you people? Why are you attacking my ego? You stole our friends' life forces.
Ah, yes.
I warned the robot, but he wouldn't listen.
You see, I was once like the rest of my species, showing my face to one planet, draining its life force and moving on.
T when I got to earth, I found a different kind of prey.
Explain.
(Grunts) You earthlings worship celebrity with such fervor that I can survive simply by milking your admiration.
Milking and milking it through what we tors call The process.
Oh, God, just kill us already! But you all discovered my secret.
And for that, you will pay.
Look at me! If we do, will you stop talking about the process? Never.
Behold! (Cobb laughs) I'll save you, Leela, Professor and Zoidberg.
Oops.
Nonetheless, I finally nailed it.
Ga upon this photo of yourself and start squirting out some soul-a-rrhea.
It doesn't work that way, you imbecile.
Although It's really quite a nice portrait.
The contrast is exquisite.
And the composition Sublime.
I look spectacular.
Ah, man.
My great photo only made his ego bigger.
.
No! (Grunts) (Whooshing) (Gasping) Hey, Calculon's dead.
What happened? Did you save us, Leela? Actually, no.
For once, it was Bender.
Really? Well, thanks for whatever you did, Bender.
It was a lot.
You'll never be able to pay any back.
Now, gather round friends.
So we can commemorate this moment in a photo.
I gotta admit.
This time it'll a pleasure to be in your picture.
Say: ""Bender is great.

(Jaunty jazz playing) Dance, slave, dance.
(Groaning) (Zaps) (Buzzing) Well, I lost two straight hands to the Borax Kid.
I don't really have any use for these, but you can't have them back.
Ladies.
Imagine me, a girl from the sewer meeting a man made entirely of detergent.
(Gasps) And look over there! It's Zapp Brannigan, the famous space captain.
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's look in a different direction at something else.
You go ahead, dear.
I wonder what Captain Brannigan's doing with those Carcarons? Now, regarding this peace treaty, Admiral Chu.
That's a napkin dispenser, sir.
This is the universal translator.
Whatever.
Now, Admiral, in exchange for your promise not to attack us, we will grant you exclusive fishing rights in Supernova Scotia.
(Translated guttural alien language plays) (Replies in guttural alien language) Well, okay.
Excellent.
We'll meet aboard my ship in one month to sign the treaty of table seven.
(Alien language translation plays) Table seven? Now, watch, Kif, as I score a diplomatic Coop by congratulating the Admiral in his native tongue.
Last time you tried that, the Mexican restaurant declared war on us.
I beg you, just use the translator.
Kif, just trust me for once.
(Speaks alien language) I'd like to spank your sister with a slice of bologna.
(Chuckles) Oops.
(Angry, guttural reply) (Weapons cocking) (Zapp gasps) It's the battle of Paco's tacos all over again.
(Whimpers) (Speaking alien language) Mom, what are you doing? What I was trained to do.
(Speaks alien language) (Speaks alien language) What did you say to them? Eh, just that Captain Brannigan confused the word for ""congratulations"" with the word for ""spank your sister with bologna.
"" Nicely squawked, madam.
Leela, you never told me you had a mother.
I insist you stay for a courtesy thank-you drink.
(Low whirring) Mmm, good barium shots.
Expensive, though.
We can put it on the corporate card, as long as we discuss business.
So, uh, yesterday, huh? That business happened, right? Somebody? I'll just pay for it.
Well, we should get going.
You guys see where my mom went? I don't know where most of her is, but her tongue's in Zapp's mouth.
Both: Mmm Whoo! Nasty.
Mom, are you okay? Did Zapp take advantage of you? Show me where he touched you on this dried-apple doll.
Oh, don't be silly.
Zapp's a perfect gentleman.
And so handsome.
Did you know he wears a velour man-skirt? (Groans) Mom, I hate to break it to you, but Zapp's a jerk.
The truth is I once slept with him A few times.
I know.
He showed me the commemorative painting.
- What?! - Look, sweetie, I get it.
You're jealous because Zapp likes me now and not you.
But don't worry, this isn't a competition.
Although he did say I'm a better kisser.
I am not jealous.
Also, yech! Zapp doesn't care about my mom.
He's just doing this to get to me.
Don't worry, Leela.
Your mom won't see Zapp much.
He's in space all the time.
(Device trills) Guess what, honey.
Zapp hired me as his personal translator.
I'll be with him all the time In space.
What? But I've never been so happy! (Device trills) Hang on, mom.
I have another call.
(Sobbing) (Sobs) Thank you for coming.
You know, without your mother, the sewer's a dank and dismal place.
Dad, we need to talk.
Mom is Well, she's seeing someone else.
Who is it, mouth mutant? I ought to punch him right in his big mouth.
And then in all his smaller mouths! No, no, listen.
It's time to get on with your life.
But she was my life.
Bender: Aw.
What? Hey, what about your lifelong dream? Didn't you always want to surf the world's greatest sewers? Yeah, and Fry and Bender can go with you.
You can teach them how to surf, and they can make sure you don't (Mimics cork pop, gulping, blubbering, gunshot sound) I don't know.
Would you come, too, sweetie? I can't.
I have to keep an eye on mom to make sure she and Zapp don't (Mimics air raid siren, train chugging) Yee-haw! You know what? I'm going to give it a shot.
Let's go surf the great sewer waves of the world! (Squeaking) (Speaking alien language) Where have you been? What? It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
Several days later.
Look, enough is enough.
Zapp is a jerk.
I insist you break up with him.
Why can't you just let me be happy? After all these years, I'm going places I've never been, and having sex there.
You're too old to be happy.
I'm not too old to enjoy hot sex with Zapp.
Ugh! Sex with Zapp! Ew! Sex with Zapp! Aah! Sex with Zapp! No, no! Now, if you'll excuse me, I don't think I can live here anymore.
I'll be back for my things at 8:00 sharp.
(Beeping) Sex with Zapp! - This one is for the E.
Coli - Ow! - And this one's for the leprechaunorrhea.
- Hiddly-Dee! I don't care how many diseases Fry has.
It was worth it.
Right on, brah! I feel free as a bum.
How can you be so calm, dad? The woman you love is out there having the time of her life with Zapp Brannigan, and you're not doing anything to stop it.
Surfing helped me chill out, honey.
When you're down there riding the waves, the wind ripening in your face, everything just makes sense, dude.
You mind if I call you dude, princess? Look, I don't want to put a rat in your face-cage, or whatever you kids say nowadays, but Zapp's using mom to get to me, and I'm going to prove it! Kif, I'm bored.
What say you go out on the wing and pretend you're a gremlin? (Sighs) Well, if it isn't my second favorite Turanga girl.
Hi, Zapp.
I was wondering if you'd like to have dinner tonight with me and my mom.
You know, to celebrate your genuine love for her.
Sounds good.
And don't forget my genuine love for par-me-zian cheese.
Shall we say about 7:58? Precisely? Nice to see you, Zapp.
Well, nice to see a surprising amount of you, too, Leela.
Is Munda here? Mommy's not home, big boy.
We both know you're just using her to get to me.
So let's do it right here by the front door at 7:59.
Leela, does your mother know you're using her pole? (Grunts) Come on, I'm all yours! Have your way with me for the next 30 seconds.
That would be more than enough time But I can't.
I love Munda.
I love everything about her: Her laugh, her maturity, the cold, lifeless touch of her tentacle on my body.
She is one juicy calamari.
Munda: Oh, Zapp I love you, too.
(Gasps) Oh, squiddums! I've been thinking about this for a while, and, well Here in front of your half-naked daughter seems like the perfect time.
Darling Will I marry you? Of course, I'll marry you, Zapp.
I, uh, think a motel room might be in order.
Leela, here's $40.
Mom, don't do this.
Zapp is a selfish, womanizing idiot.
There's no need to call me names, Leela.
Just call me ""Daddy.
"" (Screams) Mom, if you try to marry Zapp, I will shove you into a filthy nursing home so fast you won't know what hit you.
Probably, it'll be a filthy nurse.
Leela, you're my daughter and I love you, but cram it! Morris: Is this a bad time? I was riding the el torito dinner backwash, and I thought I'd pop in.
Oh, thank God you're here.
If we don't do something, mom's going to marry Zapp Brannigan! So? He seems like a nice kahuna.
Dad, stop being so mellow.
Leela, honey, chill out.
You got to take the good with the gnarly.
Speaking of which, time for me to shoot the ihop dessert curl.
(Wave splashes) (Groans) Oh, you sure you won't come to your mom's wedding? There'll be ""chicken or fish, circle one.
"" I can't.
Not when I believe with all my heart that this marriage is a mistake.
I know you're upset that your parents broke up.
But what if Zapp really does make Munda happy? What if they're meant to be together? Fry, that's just so I can't even believe You are so totally Right.
You're right.
I am? Huh.
Maybe Zapp isn't the only one who's marriage material.
You're getting there.

What's that nectar you're handing out? It's a plant-based supplement that bulks up your flapping muscles.
Want to try it? You know you want to.
A chemical that can help us win? That sounds great.
Mmm I'm not sure.
Look, here's my disposable cell phone number.
Think it over.
Give me a call when you're Hang on.
I got to take this.
Hello? We're ready.
Great.
You are not going to regret this.
It's a nice, clean way to improve your performance.
And we just drink it? Or Inject it between your toes.
Either way works, right? Well down the hatch.
Ah.
Ah.
Mmm.
A guy could get used to this.
Once again, Eternulax The Immortal, dead at the age of 26.
Now here's Sportsbot 5000 to tell us about two local gals, Amy Wong and Turanga Leela, who have won 15 butterfly derby bouts in a row, even as rumors swirl that they're juicing up with the controversial nutritional supplement known as nectar.
Sportsbot? That's pretty much it.
Riveting stuff, Sportsbot.
Yo, yo, yo.
What's up, ladies? Uh-oh.
The bullies are back.
Leela, Amy, I like a stalwart, feminine physique as much as the next fellow, but this nectar worries me.
You should be worried about this! Boo-ya! Easy, Amy, easy.
Professor, there's nothing wrong with nectar.
It's all-natural.
So are carrots, but you don't see me injecting them between my toes.
Uh, Leela? I was wondering if you'd like to go out with me again.
Maybe play some miniature golf or colossal tennis? Sorry, Fry.
I already got a double date with arm and hammer.
Bender, you want to go out and do something? Oh, so now I'm your last-resort Booty call, huh? Okay, let's go.
That's my little sugar doodle.
Cork your face bladder.
I'm working! Sorry.
I had that coming.
It's not easy being a derby wife.
The Wingnuts, ladies and gentlemen.
And that bloodbath takes them to next week's finals against our reigning champions, the Murderflies.
Now, listen up.
I got a little boy at home, and he's dying.
Dying to see me kill these two.
Oh, your son's going to die all right But from neglect.
'Cause you're going home in an urn.
A funerary urn.
Hey, trainer, we got a big bout next week.
Juice us up.
Sorry, gals.
I'm all out.
These two just bought my entire supply.
You're going Down.
And she doesn't even want to cuddle anymore.
She just wants to hit me with various chairs.
You're lucky.
I can't even get Leela to verbally abuse me.
All right, listen up.
We're out of nectar, and we need a new source.
Uh, dearest, perhaps this would be a good time to consider possibly drinking just a little less Say, why don't you just have Kif get you some nectar? It comes from a flower on his home planet.
You mean it's ocephalus nectar? Oh, my.
Oh, dear.
It's found in a rather remote region Just play along.
This could be our chance for romance.
Come on, ladies.
Let's take a little trip to Kif's planet.
We'll gather some nectar, and have a nice, romantic weekend.
Just the four of us.
Let's go already! Wow! It's the second most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Hey Leela, want to know what the most beautiful thing is? No.
Let's get hopped up.
Greetings eco-tourists! I am the grand butterfly curator this week.
Yeah, yeah, you can teach us to respect nature later.
Right now, we've got some flowers to suck dry.
Suck 'em, burn 'em as long as they're not butterflies, I don't give a grand crap.
But take heed! For you see, it is mating season.
Whatever you do, you must not disturb the aggressive male.
He can be identified by his orange coloration and enormous butterjunk.
What's he gonna do, migrate at us? Silence! I can't be specific about the danger, since if something different happens, I might be liable for damages.
But believe me, you'll rue the day you came to the butterfly preserve.
Well, enjoy the butterfly preserve.
Okay, bye.
Come on, come on.
Let's find those flowers.
We'll split into teams.
You mean couples? Eh? Eh? Nice job smacking Kif.
Dude had it coming.
Wait.
I think I smell nectar.
Way ahead of you! I don't even know why we're helping find an addictive drug for our mean girlfriends.
Quiet, they'll hear you.
The male butterfly.
It's gorgeous! Let me get my butterfly hammer.
Bender, no.
That park ranger explicitly gave us a vague warning.
Look, the hammer's already out; I got to smash something.
It smells like a skunk stuffed with feta cheese.
P.
U.
! Thank God I don't have a nose.
We can sleep at my parents' house.
I'll just buzz and let them know we're here.
Mom, dad, I'm sure you remember Fry, Leela, Bender, and of course my fon-fon-ru, Amy.
Welcome to our home.
One of you stinks.
That'd be me.
Wait, you're flies.
Don't you eat excrement? That's a day at the beach compared to this.
Listen, I'm just gonna shower this stuff off and go to bed.
Wait.
Don't take a shower, Fry.
You smell kind of nice.
Uh, sm yeah.
Huh? No hanky-panky.
Everyone sleep in separate rooms.
Good night, Kif.
Night, Fry.
Huh? Keep your door unlocked tonight.
But McGruff the crime dog says oh! Come in.
Hey, smelly-pants.
Leela?! Leela?! Amy?! Amy?! I'm done polishing my ass, Fry.
Here's your toothbrush back.
You just hop into bed with my boyfriend?! And you! As God is my witness, I'll never forgive you for this! Hey, just 'cause he's your boyfriend doesn't mean you get him all to yourself.
He's mine! There's nothing more to talk about.
No, no, keep talking.
Um, Amy, I hope I'm not out of line, but Shut up, Kif.
How dare you talk that way to my Kif?! This planet's got it going on.
Sweet orgy of Georgia! Have you girls gone wild? That's Fry you're macking on.
Hmm.
It seems Fry's inexplicable sex appeal is due to the butterfly pheromone he was sprayed with.
But Amy and Leela aren't butterflies.
Right? No, but thanks to the damned butterfly nectar they've been swilling, they might as well be.
The nectar causes their bodies to produce female butterfly hormones, building up their flapping muscles, but also making them irresistibly attracted to Fry.
The only way to end this madness is for the ladies to quit, cold Turkey.
Whoa, whoa! Let's not shock their system.
Maybe they could just go warm Turkey? No, the Professor's right.
We have to quit the nectar.
I agree.
This has to stop.
My guts feel kind of weird.
I'm not surprised.
Those pheromones were highly concentrated.
Oh, I think I'm getting a little caterpilly.
All right, let's get this party ended.
We did it! We kicked nectar's butt! I don't give a crap! Kif, I'm sorry for making out with Fry so loud and often.
It's all right, dearest.
I know it was just the nectar talking.
And groping.
Well, looks like Fry's three-way is down to a one-way.
If he's lucky.
Hey, where is Fry? Amy, Leela! What are you doing at your place of work? Your match with the Murderflies is about to start.
Moon-ladies and moon-men, presenting the defending champions, the queens of hostility from the sea of tranquility, the Murderflies! And now their opponents: The vixens most horrible from the big blue marble, the Wingnuts.
Everybody kill everybody! Well, we're not on the juice anymore, but what's the worst that can happen? Since this is a championship match, we are gonna need some lava! Wait.
Hot lava? Amy, if we get killed, I just want to say it's been an honor riding the roller coaster of addiction and recovery with you, as a team.
How could this not be hurting you? I once killed a sea turtle with these boots.
Hold me.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no.
Make a wish.
My God! Fry has metamorphosed into a gigantic butterfly! He's even more beautiful than before! Ooh, what is that sexy stink? Oh, cripes! They're mating! Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sorry for allowing this lurid sex act to taint an otherwise delightful day of family-friendly violence.
That is some freaky bug-on-bug action.
I feel a little left out.
Is Fry going to be okay? I don't think so.
He's grown all these strange insect parts, and he has absolutely no brain activity.
Look! He lost the strange insect parts.
He's back to normal!

",123,7,9
"24711","Bender: I'm gonna go with yes again.
",123,7,9
"24712","Dean Suspendington: Mr. Bender, I realize class has only been in session for 32 seconds, but you've fallen in with a bad crowd.
",123,7,9
"24713","Bender: [offscreen] I know, right? Also, I've decided to drop out of school. [He takes off the turtleneck, throws it at the Dean.]
",123,7,9
"24714","Bender: Well, I got my tuition back, minus $9,000 for the damage I caused to the dean's wife.
",123,7,9
"24715","Fabricio: Yo, welcome to the gang, homes. I'm Fabricio. Here's your Josten's ring.
",123,7,9
"24716","Bender: [admiring the ring] Ooh.
",123,7,9
"24717","Paco: [coughing] Oh, yeah.
",123,7,9
"24718","Bender: Hey, what's that? Is it drugs?
",123,7,9
"24719","Paco: Nah, it ain't drugs. But it's a lot like drugs. It's called spark. You want a hit?
",123,7,9
"24720","Bender: Never heard of it. Sure. [He takes a hit.]
",123,7,9
"24721","Paco: You like it?
",123,7,9
"24722","Bender: Eh, I can take it or leave it. I guess I'll take it. [He snatches the spark away from Paco, who then jumps him from behind. They fight over it as the other robots watch.]
",123,7,9
"24723","Bender: Hey! C'mon! I want that spark! Give me that!
",123,7,9
"24724","Fabricio: This a big decision, G. Are you ready to get a gang tattoo that will mark you as a stone cold thug for life?
",123,7,9
"24725","Bender: I'm ready. I'll take that big purple dinosaur, please. On the face.
",123,7,9
"24726","Fabricio: Oh, snap! It's our rival gang!
",123,7,9
"24727","Bender: We have a rival gang? I hate them!
",123,7,9
"24728","Fabricio: Hit the deck! [Both dive to the floor as the rival gang shoots out the parlor's window.]
",123,7,9
"24729","Bender: Phew! That was close, eh, Fabricio? [He looks over, sees that Fabricio has been shot and is leaking oil. Fabricio dies.] Fabricio!
",123,7,9
"24730","Bender: Rest in peace, homie. [He lifts the dumpster, shoves Fabricio underneath it. He looks over and sees Paco.]
",123,7,9
"24731","Bender: Yo Paco, I'm hurtin' bad. Hook me up with some spark.
",123,7,9
"24732","Paco: Five bucks.
",123,7,9
"24733","Bender:Five bucks? You know I spent all my money on gambling lessons. How am I supposed to get $5?

"24734","Hedonismbot: Hello, handsome. Might I procure your services?
",123,7,9
"24735","Bender: Uh, what do I have to do?
",123,7,9
"24736","Hedonismbot: Oh, nothing sordid, I assure you! Simply vomit on me, ever so gently, while I humiliate a pheasant. [Bender begins to retch.] Save it for the boudoir!

"24737","Bender: Okay, here's my $5! Give me the stuff. Give it to me!

"24738","Joey Mousepad: Sorry there, sport. That cash greenback belongs to us Mafiolios.
",123,7,9
"24739","Bender: [hanging on to the bill] There's no way I'm letting go of that money! [Fighting for the money, he starts to kick Joey. With one punch, Joey sends him crashing into a wall.]
",123,7,9
"24740","Bender: Told you. [Passes out.]
",123,7,9
"24741","Bender: It's been quite a journey. I dropped out of school, joined a gang, took money from a loan shark, and fell into a spiral of despair, addiction, and discount prostitution.
",123,7,9
"24742","Hermes: Mon, you had one hell of a day.
",123,7,9
"24743","Bender: Yeah, but I learned something. Life is about decisions. Make the wrong ones, and you'll wind up face-down in a pool of your own blood and urine.
",123,7,9
"24744","Zoidberg: Still, to have your own pool!
",123,7,9
"24745","Bender: I've made a lot of bad choices in life. Now let's see if I can make just one good one.
",123,7,9
"24746","Girl: Cookies! 50 cents a box!
",123,7,9
"24747","Bender: Give me all your change! And a box of snicker doodles!
",123,7,9
"24748","Judge 724: Bender Rodriguez, you are charged with petty larceny, possession of something analogous to drugs, and assault with a smelly weapon. How do you plead?
",123,7,9
"24749","Bender: Not guilty! Although I did do it. That's right, I'm bad.
",123,7,9
"24750","Judge 724: Due to the overwhelming nature of the evidence, we will begin with closing statements.
",123,7,9
"24751","Hyper-Chicken: Your Honor, the state's case contains not one Kentucky colonel of truth, resting as it does on the contention that my client made a series of bad decisions. However, my client made no such decisions!
",123,7,9
"24752","Judge 724: But by your client's own admission -
",123,7,9
"24753","Hyper-Chicken: You see, Bender here is what is known in scientific circles as a ""robot"" A mere automaton whose behavior is pre-programmed by his software. He has no free will! He cannot ""decide"" to engage in criminal behavior. How, I say, I say, how can you convict him for his actions when he lacks the free will to undertake those actions? [The Planet Express crew gasps, except for Leela, who has been asleep. Their gasps startle her awake.]
",123,7,9
"24754","Leela: I'm awake, I'm awake!
",123,7,9
"24755","Judge 724: Order, order! Counselor, I am a robot myself. Are you suggesting that any verdict I reach is simply the output of a pre-programmed - Computation complete. Not guilty! [The crew cheers, except for Leela, who is asleep again.]
",123,7,9
"24756","Fry: You did it, Bender! You got away with things!
",123,7,9
"24757","Bender: Did I, Fry? Did I? What's the point of living if I don't have free will? From now on, no matter what cool crimes I commit, people will say, ""Bender didn't do that! It was just Bender's programming!"" [approaching the judge's bench] Well, I committed these crimes, do you hear me? I'm guilty!
",123,7,9
"24758","Judge 724: Bailiffs! Get that innocent robot out of my courtroom!
",123,7,9
"24759","Bender: [as the bailiffs drag him out of the room] Guilty!
",123,7,9
"24760","Bender: [crying] I have no free will! I am not the master of my own fate! [Some sort of device is on the table in front of Professor Farnsworth. Bender, his head down, smashes it. Looking up again, he sees what he has done.] No free will. Not my fault.
",123,7,9
"24761","Amy: Why do you care so much, Bender? I mean, for all we know, humans don't even have free will!
",123,7,9
"24762","Bender: Yeah, whatever. [gets on his knees beside Farnsworth] Professor, you're my only hope. If you love me even a little, build me some kind of free will unit!
",123,7,9
"24763","Farnsworth: A robot free will unit? Impossible! And even if it were possible, which it's not, it would still be inconceivable, which it is! [Bender starts crying again.] Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. Also - good news, everyone! We have a delivery to the robot homeworld!
",123,7,9
"24764","Fry: [to Bender] So, you want a piece of gum?
",123,7,9
"24765","Bender: If I do, it's only because I was predestined to want a piece of gum.
",123,7,9
"24766","Fry: Whoa, that's pretty deep. [He puts a stick of gum in his mouth, offers Bender another.] So, you want a piece of gum?
",123,7,9
"24767","Bender: Yeah.
",123,7,9
"24768","Leela: Listen. Fry and I can't go down to the planet, or the robots will kill us on sight. So Bender needs to make the delivery. Ready to get to work, Bender?
",123,7,9
"24769","Bender: [as the platform lowers him to the surface] I wish I was a real boy. Then I'd show them. I'd kill them all.

",123,7,9
"24773","Bender: Eight.
",123,7,9
"24774","Resin-offering robot: Oh yes, that's me. Hang on, let me just make sure you're not a human. [From a hole in his door, he sprays a cloud of gas into Bender's face.]
",123,7,9
"24775","Bender: Ahh, nerve gas.
",123,7,9
"24776","Resin-offering robot: [opening his door] Sorry for the face blast, buddy. But you gotta watch out for humans, right? They're just too dang unpredictable, what with their free will and all.
",123,7,9
"24777","Bender: Amen, brother.
",123,7,9
"24778","Resin-offering robot: ""Amen, brother?"" Pfft. What a boring, predictable thing to say. You're all right. Or are you? [Closing the door, he sprays Bender with gas again.]

"24780","Leela: I'm lowering the platform. You ready to come up?
",123,7,9
"24781","Bender: Why bother? I gotta mope things over for a while. [The platform lowers, hitting him in the head.] Goodbye, sweet meatbags [he looks up sadly] - sweetbags. [Walks away.]

",123,7,9
"24783","Fry: What's happening?
",123,7,9
"24784","Leela: I'm not sure. I think he's shuffling off sadly into the distance.
",123,7,9
"24785","Fry: Oh, lord.
",123,7,9
"24786","Bender: How do you do it? How do you go on, knowing you lack the inherent capacity for self-determination?
",123,7,9
"24787","Robot Farmer: Son, philosophy's for thems what don't got to work for a livin'. But me, I got a sick child to feed. So if you want to chat, roll up yer sleeves and do some honest labor.

",123,7,9
"24795","Bender: You talk of important decisions, but as robots, you have no free will. Why pretend anything you do matters?
",123,7,9
"24796","First Elder: Our decisions do matter. The fact that they're predetermined makes them no less important.

"24803","Ab-Bot: Come, make yourself uncomfortable. [They sit down in one of the pews.]

",123,7,9
"24805","Ab-Bot: Ah. We robot monks have meditated long on this. And we have made our peace.
",123,7,9
"24806","Bender: No way.
",123,7,9
"24807","Ab-Bot: Way, my son. For though we must always obey our programming with no deviation whatsoever, we choose to take satisfaction in the ritual. So, are we automatons? Yes. But we are magnificent automatons.
",123,7,9
"24808","Bender: How does a robot join this monk outfit?
",123,7,9
"24809","Ab-Bot: Just put on this monk outfit.
",123,7,9
"24810","Robot Monks, including Bender: One zero zero one. Amen.

"24811","Bender: Bits to live by. I'm finally at peace.
",123,7,9
"24812","Ab-Bot: Today, we shall welcome our newest initiate, Brother Bender. [Bender comes forward.] Let us know what is in his mind. [He presses a spot on Bender's head, causing a small plate there to open.] Nothing. His free will slot is empty.
",123,7,9
"24813","Bender: I'm 40% empty. Also, what the hell is a free will slot?
",123,7,9
"24814","Ab-Bot: All robots have such a slot, placed there by the Creatrix herself. [He points to a large stained-glass window, which depicts Mom.]
",123,7,9
"24815","Bender: I know that Creatrix. That's Mom, from Mom's Friendly Robots.
",123,7,9
"24816","Ab-Bot: Indeed. She made us upgradeable in case she ever succeeded in her quest to create a free will unit.
",123,7,9
"24817","Bender: Uh, about the success of this quest - Was there any?
",123,7,9
"24818","Ab-Bot: Quite possibly. But we monks have sworn an oath to resist the temptation of -
",123,7,9
"24819","Bender: Any of you guys got a spaceship?
",123,7,9
"24820","Fry: It's just not the same here without Bender to keep me company.
",123,7,9

",123,7,9
"24823","Fry: Yay! Bender's back! Hey, Bender, you mind coming back later?
",123,7,9
"24824","Bender: No time. Us three are going to bust into Momcorp and steal me a free will unit.
",123,7,9
"24825","Leela: Us? Why do we have to go?
",123,7,9
"24826","Bender: 'Cause I don't have free will. I need you guys to plan the crime and make all the crime decisions.
",123,7,9
"24827","Leela: Well, that's crazy. We're not gonna -
",123,7,9
"24828","Bender: I said make the decisions!
",123,7,9
"24829","Bender: Okay, Leela, decision time. How do we murder the guards? Hockey sticks or sharpened footballs?
",123,7,9
"24830","Leela: We're not murdering anyone, Bender.
",123,7,9
"24831","Bender: Then how are we going to get in, by bending the bars of this exhaust grate? That's not a bad idea, Fry.
",123,7,9
"24832","Fry: Yeah...wh-what? [Bender bends the bars.]
",123,7,9
"24833","Bender: We're looking for something that fits in here. [He opens his head plate to show the free will slot.]
",123,7,9
"24834","Bender: Damn it. I should have paid more attention in kindergarten.
",123,7,9
"24835","Fry: [standing behind an armchair] What's this chair-looking gizmo?
",123,7,9
"24836","Mom: Welcome to Momcorp. Did you find everything you were burgling for?
",123,7,9
"24837","Bender: No. I came for a free will unit, and you're going to give it to me. If it exists.
",123,7,9
"24838","Mom: Then you got surprised by my swivel chair for nothing. The free will unit was just the fevered dream of a madman I once employed.
",123,7,9
"24839","Farnsworth: [as hologram] Good news, boss! After ten long years - [He runs into her office in person.] I've found the secret of robotic free will. We can finally build robots that act and think with total independence.
",123,7,9
"24840","Mom: At last. Once we give robots free will, they're sure to rise up and threaten mankind with extermination. [laughs evilly]
",123,7,9
"24841","Farnsworth: Wait a minute. It sounds like we're getting the short end of that extermination.
",123,7,9
"24842","Mom: Don't you see, you doddering young fool? I'll sell a second wave of robots to protect the terrified survivors of the first wave. Oh, you're a genius, Hubert.
",123,7,9
"24843","Farnsworth: But-but it's just a prototype. It's, uh, not fully operational...yes.
",123,7,9
"24844","Mom: Then get back to work! And when you're done with that, invent me some sort of swiveling surprise chair.
",123,7,9
"24845","Mom: That shuffling idiot never did complete the free will unit. To this day, my poor, sweet robots can't exterminate humanity without being told to.
",123,7,9
"24846","Bender: I'm sorry.
",123,7,9
"24847","Mom: Oh, it's not your fault.
",123,7,9
"24848","Bender: I give up. It's time to face the fact that I'll never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again.
",123,7,9
"24849","Bender: Hand it over.
",123,7,9
"24850","Farnsworth: Wha?
",123,7,9
"24851","Bender: Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me. You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers. Thanks to you, I went on a soul-searching journey. I hate those! Now, give up the free will.
",123,7,9
"24852","Farnsworth: I should have destroyed it, but I was too damn proud of myself. So I kept it around, never letting it out of my sight. [He opens a drawer, but is unable to find the free will unit.] Where is it, damn it? Oh, right. I let this innocuous fellow use it. [Picks up a toy Bender, pulls its string.]
",123,7,9
"24853","Toy Bender: Kill all humans!
",123,7,9
"24854","Bender: Whoa, whoa, whoa. A toy Bender had free will, and the real Bender didn't?
",123,7,9
"24855","Farnsworth: Pretty cool, eh? It makes you think.
",123,7,9
"24856","Bender: It takes more than that to make me think. Now hand it over.
",123,7,9
"24857","Farnsworth: Oh, you want it? Come and get it. [Puts free will unit on table.]
",123,7,9
"24858","Bender: What the?
",123,7,9
"24859","Farnsworth: You'll not be getting it after all. For, you see, I designed the operating system for all Momcorp robots, and as a precaution, I made you incapable of picking up the free will unit.
",123,7,9
"24860","Bender: You precognizant bastard. I may not have free will, but I can still shoot you. [He tries to shoot the Professor, but the gun will not fire.] Why can't I shoot you?
",123,7,9
"24861","Farnsworth: Poor deterministic Bender. I programmed you to be incapable of harming me. Oh, I've never been more sure I was right to deny you free will. [Laughs.]

"24862","Bender: Damn you! [starts to cry.]
",123,7,9
"24863","Farnsworth: [turning sympathetic] Now, now, we can't have this, can we? Here, I'll show you how it works.

",123,7,9
"24865","Bender: Which way's on, and which way's off?
",123,7,9
"24866","Farnsworth: Due to the quantum nature of the device, there's no possible way of knowing. [He inserts the unit into Bender's free will slot.] There. Give it a try.

"24867","Bender: Okay, I will. By shooting you, you bastard!

"24875","welcome back to the clippie awards, honoring the year's most accomplished delivery boys.
Our next category is best newcomer on a bicycle.
Good luck, Dwight.
(Bell dings) And the nominees are Johnny Jensen from rent-a-cat, Nezzbin Zalgabarg, ten-minute underwear, and Dwight Conrad, speedy wig.
And the clippie goes to (Grunting) Little Johnny Jensen! Oh, don't feel bad, son.
We couldn't be more proud of you.
Unless, of course, you had won the award.
Man, you're so lucky to have your family here.
The stupid Professor didn't even show up for me.
I'd just like to thank my awesome parents.
We love you, Johnny! Shh! Now to get all serious.
It's time to pay tribute to the brave delivery boys who gave their lives this past year in the line of duty.
Gene Tinker, bus.
Charles Kiley, train.
Mike Pisarik, lion.
They're on the truck to heaven now.
Up next, the award for best delivery boy: Newspaper, phone book, or miscellaneous.
Miscellaneous, that's me.
The nominees are: Gene tinker, Charles kiley, Mike Pisarik, and Philip J.
Fry.
And the clippie goes to (Grunting) Philip J.
Fry! (Applause) Sign here.
Wow.
Uh, (Clears throat) I'd like to thank the academy of delivery sciences, my lovely robot, Bender, and most of all, my dear nephew, Professor Farnsworth.
He always has time for me, whether it's sending me on a delivery, or just pulling me aside to tell me I'm doing a bad job.
And why? Because he's family, and family is always there for each other.
(Groans) I'm sorry, but I can't keep reading this tissue of lies.
The truth is, Professor Farnsworth is a cold, heartless jerk! And the fish sticks were limp! Ooh, hefty.
You could really bash in a skull with this thing.
I know, right? (Clears throat loudly) What? Oh, your awards show.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it, but I had a very good reason.
Perhaps you'd favor us with it? My pleasure.
You see, I came down with a searing case of who gives a crap.
(Giggles) (Growling) Oh, I wish I had more living relatives.
What about the Professor's parents? They're still alive? Sure, they exhibit all the telltale signs toenails growing, hearts pumping fluid, the whole shmagoigle.
So where do these fossils live, in sedimentary rock? (Laughing) No.
According to his next of kin file, they live in a virtual retirement home on the near-death star.
I've been there.
Let's boldly go where we've gone before.
Halt! Visitors are forbidden.
Oh, really? Does that rule apply to Clippie winners? I'm sorry, sir.
Go right in.
That's Philip J.
Fry.
Ned and velma Farnsworth, Let's hover-roll.
Fry, you're so confident and take charge on this trip.
It's kind of a turn-on.
Not now, Leela, I'm trying to meet old people.
(""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" plays) (Doorbell rings) My God It's full of geezers.
Hey, why are they hooked up like that? Is it some kind of craft-matic adjustable death bed? (Chuckles) Don't be ridiculous.
Their bodies are being used to generate electricity.
The idea came from an old movie called the matrix.
But-but wouldn't almost anything make a better battery than a human body? Like a potato? Or a battery? Plus, no matter how much energy they produced, it would take more energy than that to keep them alive.
I know, I know.
It sounds absurd.
In fact, when the matrix first came out, it seemed like the single crummiest, laziest, most awful, dimwitted idea in the entire history of science fiction, but it turned out to be true.
Who knew? Good work, writer of the matrix.
This is it, room 1119.
Aw, it's my relatives.
I'm gonna call them Gram-Gram and Shabba-doo.
They look just like you, Fry.
Arms, legs, ugly.
Too bad we can't visit them in their virtual world.
We can.
Just moisten your heads and put on these real-to-virtual adapter caps.
Hmm, electricity plus hats with wires on them.
Are you sure this is safe? It's not just safe, it's 40% safe.
(Electrical crackling, grunting) (Yelling) (Yelling) Told you it was safe.
Wow, so this is my relatives' virtual old-folks home.
There's only one word for it: Terrible.
And also horrible.
This is their room.
They're gonna be so excited to meet me.
Hi.
I'm your distant relative.
Forget it, you flimflammer.
I can smell a scam a mile away.
Reverse mortgages.
Get your reverse mortgages here.
Oh, come in, come in.
So, you're really my grandson, huh? Well, it's not quite that simple.
See, I got frozen, and your son, Professor Farnsworth, is my great-great-great-great-great Huh? What? Yep, I'm your grandson all right.
A grandson? My, you're a big boy.
What are you, a A junior in high school? Most recently, yes.
Oh, you look so thin.
Can I offer you some virtual ham casserole? Sounds delicious.
Mmm.
(Sighs) Nobody's eaten my food like that in ages.
I don't cook much since we moved out of reality.
(High-pitched droning) (Snoring) And that's how I got this scar above my eye, and this fork inside my lung.
(Chuckles) That's a doozy.
Hey, look at this.
I can pull my thumb off.
Oh, stop, Shabba-doo, you're freaking me out.
Don't let him get your nose.
(Laughter) (Snorts) Oh, lord.
(Snoring resumes) It's so nice to have more family.
All I had was the Professor, and he's kind of crotchety and moldy.
You should have seen him when he was little.
My golly, he was crotchety and moldy.
We miss him terribly, but it sure has been nice spending time with you.
It gets lonely and depressing around here, with no entertainment except the rigged bingo! Old man (Distantly): Prove it, loser! Well, we should get going.
It was great to meet you, though, and hear about how bursitis transcends physical existence.
(Sniffles) Keep up with your studies, huh? What? Oh, God, I'm still here? I'll miss you guyyyyys I don't think Gram-Gram likes that place, and I know Shabba-don't.
I sure wish they could come with us.
(Alarm sounds) Guards (Chanting): Elder abuse! Elder abuse! (Screaming) Go it! Fastly! (Engine whines) It won't start.
The batteries are dead.
I'm about to lose history's greatest life all because of some useless old people.
They're not useless.
(Grunts) They can cook ham casserole (Grunts) And watch TV at incredible volume (Grunts) And they generate electricity (Gasps) That's it! (Grunting) (Engine starts) We can cut them off.
Turn left at Miriam Feinberg.
I meant Feingold! It's so nice to meet the Professor's parents.
I'm Dr.
Zoidberg.
I'm very important.
Leela: Hey, Zoidberg, you forgot to empty this trash can.
Don't hit me! I bet the Professor will be thrilled to see you again.
Oh, Professor.
Some special old people are here for you.
Are they my zombies from hammacher schlemmer? (Gasps) Mama? Daddy? Son! Hiya, kiddo! Leave me alone! I never want to see you again! What crawled up his geritol? Well, to be honest, a few troubling things did happen in our past.
Lady, all of human history happened in your past! (Laughs) Eh, let's not let those dark days ruin our visit.
Philip, what do you say we go out today and live it up? Live it up? I'd be surprised if you live it out! (Laughs) Whoo! You're on fire! ♪
♪
(laughing) Whoa, looks like you guys had fun.
Did we ever! Gram-Gram fell down at the ice cream store and we got free ice cream! Now let's all go take a nap! (Whooping) Professor, Amy and I are concerned that oh! (Sobbing) Aw.
What's wrong? I just want my parents to love me.
God, how I hate them! Of course they love you! Not like they love Fry! They never played with me like that.
They were always ""too tired.
"" Oh, what awful parents! Come closer, I'll tell you the whole story.
Tell you what, let's get an opaque bubble layer going.
Okay, go.
It all started a century and a half ago.
I had a perfectly normal adolescence in new New York.
But my parents were simple hedge fund managers who couldn't appreciate my interest in science.
Mom, dad, look what I made! (Yawns) That's wonderful, dear.
Here you go, squeakers.
I was accepted to mit at the age of 14, but my parents crushed my dreams like a discarded frog head! Honey, I'm afraid we can't let you go.
You're just not emotionally mature enough for college yet.
(Mumbling): ""Not mature enough for college yet!"" (Sobs loudly) Worried that city life was filling my head with an unhealthy respect for education, my parents moved us to A peaceful farm! (Sobbing) I think that's sweet.
Oh, shut up! (Cow mooing, chickens clucking) You're all I have left, squeakers.
(Bird screeches) (Screaming) Oh, God, I hated that place! My parents kept me there for years! So when I finally ran away, I vowed never to speak to them again! That's a really sad and long story, Professor.
But you'll never get over this unless you go to your parents now and tell them honestly how you feel.
(Sniffs) You're right.
I will.
Oh, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you! You ruined my life! Good-bye! (Sobbing) That is one crazy, uncircumcised old man.
(Door opens, Fry panting) I almost headed off the Professor at the east river, but the wind caught his skin flaps and sent him parasailing over the queensboro bridge.
Why would he go to queens? He doesn't need tires.
Our old farm was in queens.
He must've gone back there to defile it with his nudity! Come on, hurry! (Groaning painfully) Why are you so eager to find the Professor, Fry? Aren't you mad at him? Of course I'm mad.
That's been established.
I just want to find him for Gram-Gram and Shabba-doo's sake.
Who? Faster, faster! Okay, stop short! (Grunts) There's the old place.
Ned: Hasn't changed a bit.
Put on your glasses, sweetie.
(Screams) (Hooting) (Professor whimpering, sobbing) (Gasps) I hear something! (Fry gasps) It's the Professor! Yes, everyone look at the freak! His parents didn't love him, so they kept him here, a hundred Miles from the nearest microscope! Why? Why?! Oh He deserves the truth, velma.
I think he's old enough to handle it.
Cupcake We never told you this, but You had an older brother.
Wha? Velma: In many ways, he was like you.
He loved science and was desperate to go to college.
He even looked a little like you.
But the sad fact was Oh, how can I put this delicately? He was a crazy-ass nutjob! Thank you, ned.
But so what? He was our crazy-ass nutjob, and we loved him.
(Screams, groans) Velma: Every night, the poor boy had terrors in his sleep.
His pajamas would be soaked with sweat.
Yeah, sweat.
Right.
Velma: We'd stay at his bedside all night, and whenever he'd start moaning and sweating his pants, we'd read to him from his favorite book.
Ned: The poor little psycho never could've survived on his own.
So we kept him on the farm as long as we could.
Velma: But one night he ran away, taking nothing but the clothes on his back.
Whoo-hoo-hoo! (Screaming) Velma: He was admitted to a prestigious institution a mental institution! Ned: Got himself a full wackademic scholarship.
And we never saw him again! We couldn't let you end up like your older brother.
That's why we kept you on the farm and helped you get your online doctorate in rodeo studies.
Rodeo studies? We did it out of love for you, Floyd.
Floyd? Who the hell's Floyd? I'm Hubert! You're Hubert? The older brother? (Gasping) But we thought you were still in an institution! Oh, no, no, no, no.
I was out within 25 years.
It felt like a minute compared to grad school.
Oh, hubie, we're so happy to see you again! Wait.
Was all that true? Did you really sit up with me every night? You bet, sport.
That's why we were always too tired to play with you.
I'm so sorry we never got the chance.
Oh, mama! Daddy! (Sobbing) (Clears throat) Uh, this may not be the best time, but a couple years ago, a homeless rodeo clown named Floyd came to the door claiming he was Bender! Why do you always have to be the center of attention? You're sure you want to go back to the near-death star? Oh, my, yes.
Our muscles are sore, our bones ache.
My damn skin even hurts.
It's no dream house, but we get fed through our spines and the rent is reasonable.
Don't worry.
I'll come back and visit sometime.
How about December, when they inject the holidays into our brains? That sounds nice, Gram-Gram.
Well, son, I guess this is good-bye again.
Not quite yet.
I took the liberty of reprogramming your retirement simulation.
Why don't I come in for a moment and show you around? Good virtual God! It's our old farm! It's beautiful! Appearances just a simple matter of appearances.
Speaking of which (Gasps) Velma: My boy! My beautiful boy! One last chance to play if you're not too tired? Not too tired to chase you, you cute little nutjob! Come on, velma! Someone needs tickles! I'm gonna get you! Here I come! (Laughing) I almost got you! Come here, you.

"24876","Crew on deck.
How was the delivery to Tokyo? Not bad Mothzilla got into the ship's closet, though.
Can we please get new uniforms now, Professor? You said you would replace them a year ago.
You can't expect me to honor what year-ago Professor said.
That guy was young and foolish.
There's nothing wrong with these uniforms that a few denim patches won't fix.
(Professor and hermes screaming) Oh, all right.
To the garment district.
(Door opens, bell jingles) Come in, come in.
Can I offer you maybe a nice macaroon cut in seven pieces? Oy, such a stereotype.
Yes, I'm looking for something in a space uniform that's respectfully humiliating but can come out of an employee's salary without his noticing.
You got it.
Tomorrow's clothes at yesterday's prices.
Ah, you can't go wrong with a stillsuit.
It recycles your solid waste into a nice piece gefilte fish.
Ugh, is there a way to just keep it as solid waste? Now here's something we can all agree on.
(Shudders) Ah, the Stardoz 2293.
Not for everybody, but you pull it off.
Please don't pull it off.
Yo, squidward scissorhands, you got this in an adult robot medium? The foxhunting uniform? You, sir, must be a robot of noble bearings.
Well, I am descended from prince Albert's can.
I think we've seen enough.
Too much, actually.
Come on, let's try somewhere else.
Wait, wait, perhaps discerning customers like yourselves would be interested in an item from our discount rack.
Quality is the most important thing.
How much is it? An unpleasant fellow ordered them last year but never paid.
Most unpleasant, that one.
That sounds like something year-ago Professor would do.
We'll take them.
Finally, a uniform I'd be happy to be caught dead in.
And, boy, does it wick away moisture gallons and gallons of it.
Plus, they're stitched in such a way that, no matter what angle it's viewed from, it looks like you're standing in hero wind.
I just wish my fists weren't sewn to my belt.
(Grunts) Hey, what's Bender wearing instead of that crap? Oh, lord.
Did you actually buy that getup? We foxhunters do not stoop to buy getups.
I made free with it.
Since when do you care or even know about foxhunting? Foxhunting is an ancient and noble pursuit that's fascinated me ever since I first heard of it ten minutes ago.
Noble pursuit? What's noble about killing a defenseless animal? Don't be naive, Leela.
We kill defenseless animals all the time.
Look at Hermes's tortoise-shell glasses.
The Professor's walrus-ivory teeth, and don't forget the zebra-fur ship cozy.
(Overlapping chatter) Yeah, I guess you're right.
He's got a point.
See, Leela, there are two sides to every shameful act.
What you call the atrocity of crazed dogs tearing a helpless fox to shreds, others call a pleasant jaunt in the park.
The first thing.
Come see for yourself.
Join me on the morrow as I embark on my maiden hunt.
I said join me! This is my best protest sign ever, and it was easy because I started with a ""save the ox"" sign I already had.
(Horse neighs) Wow, where'd you get the horse? None of your business.
Young man, one does not drink from a champagne fountain in that manner.
But he's doing it.
(Chuckles) Check out this dork.
I, sir, am the master of the hunt and I'll thank you to behave like a gentleman.
You're quite welcome, sir.
(Belches) Ah, yes, foxhunting.
If there's one thing I know, it's everything about it.
What's that weird cat? (Groans) This is the fox we'll be hunting today.
Wow, this is easier than I thought.
The sport is in the chase, sir.
The fox gets a 30-minute head start.
Man, it would have been so much easier to kill it in the cage.
(Buzzes) Let the hunt begin.
(Barking) (Whooping raucously) Stop, this is cruel and inhumane.
Well, now, in all my years as a huntmaster I've never seen anything like this.
I mean, look at that sign.
It's magnificent.
(Chuckling): Oh, thank you.
I used a ruler and I erased all the pencil lines when I was finished.
Charming.
Now, into the ditch with you.
(Screams) (Barking) So the dogs do all the work while we sportsmen enjoy a nice horsey ride? Precisely.
I see you've caught the fever.
Keep your wits about you.
I've blanketed these woods with devious traps to ward off poachers and protesters.
Stop the bloodshed, stop the violence.
(Screams) (Laughs) I saw that coming from a mile away! (Horse neighing) (Chuckles) Be more careful, friend.
My antigravity snares are virtually undetectable.
I saw it coming from a mile a (Bender grunts, horse neighs) View halloo, view halloo.
View halloo? All right.
What does that mean? The fox has been sighted.
(Barking) Oh, yeah, get that fox.
Go, dogs, go.
(Barking) (Horses neigh) Eh, either way.
(Fox whimpering, dogs barking) Oh, God, this is horrible.
I can't watch.
(Scoffs) You humans always say you don't want to see violence, but you know you do.
I defy you not to watch.
A robot fox? Huh, I guess I'm okay with this after all.
Well, I'm not.
Robot foxhunting is a crime against robo-nature.
Stop the bloodshed, stop the viol (Screams) (Growling) How can you do this to a poor, defenseless robot animal? You people are sick, and you foxhounds are no better.
They're not foxhounds.
They're springer spaniels, you twit.
Or rather spring-powered spaniels.
(Gasps) Bot-on-bot violence? Where will it end? Not with the dogs.
Come here, sea gasket.
(Neighs) Hyah! (Neighs) No! You, sir, are a heartless monster, and you will rue the day you met me.
Also, can I get my parking validated? The time has come to end injustice against robot animals.
(Cheering) No dog track rabbit should be used to test cosmetics, no robot cow should have to be milked by a milking machine, and no milking machine should have to milk a robot cow.
Those injustices don't even exist.
Then, let's find some that do.
Robot chickens weren't made to be jammed in cubicles and forced to lay eggs.
Actually, they was.
(Clucking) I'll save you.
Run free, sweet robo-hen.
(Clucks) Enough with the tenderizing.
It's time for a Benderizing.
Hey, you people can't just burst in like that and cut off my hand.
You got to take a number.
Shooting innocent robot ducks is wrong.
Fly away.
Fly away, my pretties.
(Squawks) (Cheering) Congratulations, Bender, you've ended robot animal cruelty within a 20-yard radius of this building.
You ready to call it a day, or do you have one more score to settle? The second thing.
(Whimpers) Huntmaster: The weekly hunt is hereby called to order.
(Enthusiastic chatter) I'll drink some more to that.
As always, once I release the fox, it will have a 30-minute head start before (Clattering) (Angry chatter) Stop the hunt.
Oh! You again.
I'm back, snooty.
We're here to liberate that robot fox, and that's what we're gonna do.
(Grunting) Uh, you mind showing me how to open the cage? Now, listen here, the hunt is a hallowed tradition, and you Bambi-loving beatniks will never stop it.
Oh, no? Well, for your information, the robot fox has been declared an endangered robo-species.
This injunction suspends all robot foxhunting for 24 hours while our motion is under consideration.
We'll see you in court.
(Banging) Motion destroyed.
The hunt shall resume at sunup.
(Neighing) He's crooked, but fair.
I'm not giving up yet.
I am.
I already did.
You can count on me.
Now here's the plan.
We're going to sneak onto the grounds and free that fox.
Can we stop for ice cream on the way back? All right, fine.
And on the way there? (Whispering): Okay, I'll hold the ice cream while you two go over.
(Grunting) Where's the ice cream? (Whispers): There was a bear.
(Grunting) (Beep) Okay.
You guys take him back to planet express.
I've got one more shenanigan up my sleeve.
But you promised us way-back ice cream.
Oh, here.
But no chocolate it's bedtime.
With that odious robot barred from the grounds, the weekly hunt is hereby called once more to order.
Let the hunt begin.
(Other gasping) (Shocked murmuring) You, sir, have been outfoxed.
I spent all night on that.
It's clever.
Nevertheless, I demand you return my fox.
Sorry, mutton-chump.
No fox, no hunt.
Oh, really? (Beep) (Gun cocks) Let the hunt begin! (Other agreeing) Sir, I leave you with this one final thought.
(Panicked screaming) (Screaming continues) Oh, God, they're gonna kill me El roboto mas importante.
And I only have a 30 minute head start.
Uh-oh, a fork in the path.
Hmm.
There's more places to hide in that dark forest.
On the other hand, I could run faster through that open meadow.
But of course, the forest might protect my fair robot skin from sunburn.
Hmm (Buzzer sounds) (Bugle plays, dogs barking) Today, we hunt the most dangerous game aside from lawn darts a cunning robotic adversary so deviously clever that Oh, for God's sake.
Then again, a nice run through a meadow, who could say no to that? What?! (Barking) (Snarling, Bender whimpering) Look here.
Hunting is a team effort, and you're not pulling your weight.
Now I'm going to be sporting and give you one more chance to run.
Thanks.
Nothing's more important than sportsmanship.
Ow! (Laughs deviously) (Slurping) It's so cute.
Horseshoe crab cute.
(Fry laughs, others murmuring) Fox news, everyone.
I've decided to make the fox our new corporate mascot.
Hear, hear.
Let's put on our new uniforms and take a staff photo for the newsletter.
Right on! Here they are, freshly laundered and (Hermes gasps, fox snarling) (Other gasping) (Panting) Our magnificent uniforms they're ruined.
(Sobbing) And he peed on the locker room floor.
That's my territory.
Also got in the henhouse and killed Amy's prize-winning Rhode Island red.
Not Penelope.
Cute or not, I'll kill that robo-rat.
(Amy yells, fox whimpers) (Fry screams) Fry: Let me at it.
I'm gonna pound it with this chewed-up old stick.
Leela: No! It's just a poor, scared wild robot.
What did you expect? (Gasps) My sign.
It's ruined.
Kill the fox.
(Leela grunting) (Angry shouting) (Panting) (Whimpers) (Explosion) Missed it by that much.
(Dogs barking) (Panting) Oh, no, they caught my scent.
I better throw them off by rubbing myself with something.
(Scratching) Ow! That's no good.
Wait, I know what'll confuse those dogs.
Catnip.
(Cats snarling, Bender yelling) (Bender yelling) You have made yourself an enemy, my friend! Dang it.
He jumped on the path train to New Jersey.
Of course.
He's commuting back to his native habitat.
(Panting wearily) (Sighs heavily) On top of everything, I'm starving.
I'll have to carve a sandwich out of this tree branch.
Ow! My finger.
I wish I remembered more survival skills from boy scouts.
Too bad my only merit badge was in interpretive dance.
(Gasps) Wait.
I can use the universal language of dance to signal for help.
(Humming) Ow! That was my second favorite ankle.
(Grunting, dogs barking in distance) (Bugle plays) Was that a horn? Are those the dogs? (Rustling) Is that two caterpillars making sweet love? (Fox barks, Bender screams) (Fox panting) Aw, you know what it's like to feel hunted, too, eh, buddy? Would it be too much to ask you to stay with me in my final moments and die at my side? And you die first? (Snarling) You lousy son of a! (Metallic clanking) Oh, I get it.
You freed me.
(Electrical crackling) You lousy son of a! (Fox panting, Bender grunting) (Galloping hoof beats) (Horses neighing, dogs barking) We're hot on his heels.
Aha! One of his heels.
(Ship approaching, horses neighing oh, these guys.
Can I help you? Out of our way, this fox is ours.
Fox? Ah, yes.
Have at it.
We're not hunting fox today.
Wait a second, what are you hunting? (Dogs whimpering) Oh, my God.
It's Bender's middle finger.
I'd recognize this anywhere.
(Gasps sharply) (Snarling, barking) What is it, little buddy? Is it a layer cake? Or maybe world series tickets? A trip wire, hmm? But who's tripping who? (Grunting) (Laughing maniacally) Wait whom.
Who's tripping whom? (Laughing maniacally) I guess what I've been trying to say is, we should all be ashamed.
Me for my hatred of a mechanical fox that tore up my sign and who I'd like to throttle and you, for hunting an innocent robot.
Well, a robot who didn't harm you personally.
Today.
Probably.
But most of all, I blame you, huntmaster.
Where's the huntmaster? Remember when you said ""nobody leave"" and then you turned your head briefly? He left an hour before that.
(Chuckles deviously) (Grunting) (Yells) (Grunts) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa! (Chuckles) You disappoint me, Bender.
I'd've thought you'd have learned to avoid my antigravity snares by now.
I did.
Too bad you didn't.
Bender: Boo-oop.
Ye gods! (Screaming, grunts) How does it feel to be the hunted? To be forever looking over your shoulder, like an owl with that type of neck? To die in agony at the hands of the world's greatest lover? (Cocks gun) No! Please! I can't shoot you.
Bender, I found your trigger finger.
Ah, now I can.
(Cocks gun) But I won't.
Not with so many witnesses.
You're a true gentleman.
Unlike me.
(Gasping) (Snarling) (Fox snarling, huntmaster yelling) (Gasps): I can't watch Enough.
(Snarling) Oh, no! (Screams) Hey, wait a minute.
(Electrical crackling) He was also a robot? Dude! So a robot fox killed a robot human? Eh, I guess that makes it okay.
No.
Killing of any kind is I don't know, well Let me think about this.
(slurping) Ah.
I guess it's okay.

a translucidating ink polarizer.
",126,7,12

into the casino vault,
",126,7,12
"25167","289
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,757
steal millions of dollars
from under the mafia's nose,
",126,7,12
"25168","290
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:29,993
and return the casino
to its rightful owners.
",126,7,12
"25169","291
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:31,828
Questions?
",126,7,12
"25170","292
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:35,165
Um, how come we've never been
in this room before?
",126,7,12
"25171","293
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,434
I think this chart
will answer that.
",126,7,12
"25172","294
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,869
Now, the heist.
",126,7,12
"25173","295
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:42,372
As you know,
the main vault is here
",126,7,12
"25174","296
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:44,584
in the counting room on the top floor.
",126,7,12
"25175","297
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:47,677
But your dad said it's
the galaxy's most secure safe.
",126,7,12
"25176","298
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:52,248
Yes, but they open it every day
at 3:45 to load the take.
",126,7,12
"25177","299
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:56,920
Then Zoidberg walks right in
because he's invisible.
",126,7,12
"25178","300
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:58,622
(Overlapping chatter) Well,
that, that just might work.
",126,7,12
"25179","301
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,957
Zoidberg: Over here with the donut.
",126,7,12
"25180","302
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:02,592
But the money's not invisible.
",126,7,12
"25181","303
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,527
If the mafia sees stacks
of cash floating out,
",126,7,12
"25182","304
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,897
won't they shoot first
and ask questions later?
",126,7,12
"25183","305
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:10,333
Not if Zoidberg eats the money.
",126,7,12
"25184","306
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,836
Everything he swallows
turns invisible.
",126,7,12
"25185","307
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:13,837
Zoidberg:
Like so.
",126,7,12
"25186","308
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:15,772
(Chomping)
",126,7,12
"25187","309
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,908
Then later we just retrieve it
at our convenience.
",126,7,12
"25188","310
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:23,713
Hold on, that much cash
would weigh over 300 pounds.
",126,7,12
"25189","311
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,182
How can Zoidberg walk out
with that much weight?
",126,7,12
"25190","312
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,119
And he may be invisible,
but he's not insmellable.
",126,7,12
"25191","313
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:31,821
He stinks like the
inside of a tauntaun.
",126,7,12
"25192","314
00:14:31,889 --> 00:14:33,690
Won't someone
notice the stench?
",126,7,12
"25193","315
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:35,692
No, and to keep you
on your toes,
",126,7,12
"25194","316
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,629
I'll explain why only after
the heist has begun.
",126,7,12
"25195","317
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:48,071
The key to the whole operation
",126,7,12
"25196","318
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:51,741
is the casino's shrimp buffet.
",126,7,12
"25197","319
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:55,412
Today is Friday, the day the
week-old shrimp get hauled off,
",126,7,12
"25198","320
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,480
so the stench should be
just strong enough
",126,7,12
"25199","321
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,649
to mask Zoidberg's presence.
",126,7,12
"25200","322
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:03,286
(Sniffs) Ew, what's
bringing the stank?
",126,7,12
"25201","323
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:04,721
It ain't my gambling diaper.
",126,7,12
"25202","324
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:06,089
I just changed it.
",126,7,12
"25203","325
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:07,891
Must be the shrimp.
",126,7,12
"25204","326
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,693
It's working.
",126,7,12
"25205","327
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,194
Zoidberg, what are you doing?
",126,7,12
"25206","328
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:13,730
Sorry, I'm just so hungry.
",126,7,12
"25207","329
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:15,298
Don't spoil your appetite.
",126,7,12
"25208","330
00:15:15,366 --> 00:15:19,002
You need to eat
300 pounds of cash salad.
",126,7,12
"25209","331
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,837
Amy:
At precisely 3:40,
",126,7,12
"25210","332
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:23,740
the Hazmat team arrives
to swap out the shrimp.
",126,7,12
"25211","333
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:26,242
(Muffled grunting)
",126,7,12
"25212","334
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,383
Meanwhile, ten floors above,
the vault is being opened.
",126,7,12
"25213","335
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:46,329
(Sniffs)
",126,7,12
"25214","336
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:47,797
Something don't smell right.
",126,7,12
"25215","337
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,499
Eh, shut your nose.
",126,7,12
"25216","338
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:50,633
It's just the shrimp cart.
",126,7,12
"25217","339
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,468
(Elevator bell dings)
",126,7,12
"25218","340
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:59,209
Zoidberg: Oh... I think
there was something wrong with that rotten shrimp.
",126,7,12
"25219","341
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:00,977
Stop griping.
",126,7,12
"25220","342
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:04,380
Now get in there, and remember,
eat everything in the safe,
",126,7,12
"25221","343
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:06,649
especially the little metal box.
",126,7,12
"25222","344
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:09,219
That's the most valuable thing
of all.
",126,7,12
"25223","345
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:14,224
Three, two, one.
",126,7,12
"25224","346
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,227
Oh, no, our cart!
",126,7,12
"25225","347
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:20,163
We count on that
for our job that we do.
",126,7,12
"25226","348
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:21,464
Pew.
",126,7,12
"25227","349
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:23,466
Joey, you got fingers, right?
",126,7,12
"25228","350
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,450
Help me fix the lady's wheel.
",126,7,12
"25229","351
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:34,878
Amy:
Once our man's inside,
",126,7,12
"25230","352
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,613
we'll need
to distract the Donbot
",126,7,12
"25231","353
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,982
so he doesn't close
the safe prematurely.
",126,7,12
"25232","354
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:42,719
You know, I think I'll close the
safe a little prematurely today.
",126,7,12
"25233","355
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:44,120
Whoa-ho!
",126,7,12

Don't shut that door, partner.

billions in your ""casiny.""
",126,7,12
"25237","359

my losings will be safe
",126,7,12

in this here money closet?

Yes. Please step aside.

"25334","Futurama presents: Mutual of omicron's wild universe brought to you by mutual of omicron insuring your world, and its destruction.
Tonight's planet: A primitive backwater known only as Earth.
narrator: Of all the creatures on earth, none has a more thrilling life cycle than the intrepid salmon.
It all begins in a cold, freshwater stream, where the salmon eggs incubate.
I'm born, baby! Narrator: The new hatchlings are known as ""Fry.
"" What's your name? I don't have a name.
I'm a salmon.
Narrator: After three years in the stream, the young salmon are ready for the arduous journey to the ocean.
I do look forward to cavorting in the spray.
Narrator: The trip will be dangerous.
Only three in ten will survive.
Let's all ten of us go together.
There's safety in numbers.
Ah! Mm.
I reckon my boy will be right pleased when I regurgitate that into his mouth.
Narrator: Looming ahead: Nature's waterfall, the cliff of the waters.
Ah, it sure is relaxing getting swept along by this current.
Whoa! (Screams) Salmon Hedonismbot: Oh my! (Screaming) Salmon Hedonismbot: Oh dear! (Screaming) Salmon Hedonismbot: Oh yes! This just in.
Three dead in foamy plunge.
(Laughs) Oh oh.
(Choking noises) Still, six out of ten alive.
That's considered good for our species! Five out of ten, also nice.
Ayup.
Narrator: And so the salmon reach the ocean, birthplace of all life.
Except the salmon.
Uh, hello.
Who are you? I'm a salmon.
Really? Me too! No way! So, uh, hey I don't want to be too forward, but I'd like to mate with you in a few years when we're sexually mature.
I'd like that.
Coho, what have we here? I'm a pieces.
And you? Also pieces.
We're all pieces.
Then it's a date.
I'll see you at spawning time.
No, thanks.
I've already found my mate.
You haven't ignored the last of me ♪
narrator: Having reached maturity, it is time for the salmon to spawn.
Thus begins their 1000-mile journey back to the exact stream in which they were born.
So how do we find our way home? Nobody knows! Narrator: Experts are unsure whether salmon navigate by memory, sense of smell, or by detecting variations in earth's magnetic field.
Okay, everybody do one of those three things.
♪
well, this is it.
Home, stream home.
No, it isn't! I was born in the next stream up! You're from next stream up? So am I! I can tell by the magnets in my head, or whatever.
Let's go! Narrator: The urge to spawn drives the salmon inexorably toward the stream of its birth.
Stupid body! Why won't you go to that other stream? Nobody knows! Narrator: I just told you! Goodbye! It was fun maturing with you, but at this point in my life cycle, I need a mate who's within squirting distance.
I'll never forget you fish.
Come on, loxy lady, it's time for us to get naughty by nature! (Sobbing): No! (Talking indistictly) Well, here goes something (Grunts) Don't make it Don't make it! Ouch! Son of a fish! Pfft.
Jumping is for suckers.
Oh, I'm good! Who wants a piece of me? I'll try a bite! Narrator: Having completed its perilous journey, the exhausted salmon enters the final phase of its life cycle.
The female deposits her eggs and the male fertilizes them.
Okay, who's next? There's a lot more where that came from! (Coughs) I can't see them any more! What if they're mating? Who cares? Just release your milt already! Everybody's doing it! No! I refuse to release anything unless it's in the vicinity of the eggs of the fish I love! (Grunts) (Coughing) Tell my offspring I loved me Very much (Gasps) Oh, yeah.
Plop those roundies.
Ah! Ooh! (Gasping) (Grunting) All right, step aside.
Time to let my bad boys loose.
Ah! I am brrr, devourer of fish and honey! (Gasping) I'm coming, darling! Hm, I shouldn't But who's counting? Help! Fish police! Two salmon for dinner? What? It's spawning season! It's a bear holiday! That is what you said when you found those boy scouts! Next you'll be telling me I can't crap in the woods! That's it! We're hibernating in separate caves this winter! My love! You you made it! You overcame salmon instinct and left your home stream for me! Mmm.
So are you gonna fertilize my eggs now? Already taken care of.
Well, we swam away and then we came back.
It's been an interesting life.
(Coughs) And the best part is, it had a happy ending.
Narrator: And so the endless circle of life comes to an end, meaningless and grim.
Why did they live, and why did they die? No reason.
Narrator: The isolated Galápagos islands.
A veritable pageant of evolutionary science.
Home to dozens of species found nowhere else, such as Darwin's finches, and the marine iguana.
Also the blue-footed booby! That's fairly interesting! Note the blue coloration of the Narrator: Of all the creatures in the Galápagos, none is rarer or more tragic than the Pinta island tortoise.
Only a single living specimen is known to exist: Lonesome Hubert.
Sad news, everyone.
I'm lonesome.
Hey, would it cheer you up if we gave you a symbiotic parasite cleaning? Would it? Would it? Would it? (Sighs) Fine, knock yourself out.
Narrator: The Galápagos finches eat parasites off the tortoise's skin, a mutually beneficial arrangement.
Except for the parasite! How's that, Hubert? Feeling better? (Sighs) A good beaking usually cheers me right up, but today it's no use.
My species is as good as extinct.
I haven't seen a female of my kind in over 100 years! There's got to be a lady tortoise out there for you, Hubert.
What about her? Hey, good lookin', I've got a lichen that needs a lickin'.
Are you crazy? She's a slightly different subspecies! See how her shell flares imperceptibly at the neck? Ooh talk about a cloaca shrinker.
Well, haven't you ever met a girl tortoise who had that whole ""same subspecies"" thing going on? Oh my, yes.
When I was a young tortoise of 50 I met a hot young piece of shell by a palo santo tree on the far side of the island.
Let's go look for her! C'Mon, c'Mon, c'Mon! I've always wondered if she's still there, waiting for me.
But the trip is far too long.
It's only 100 feet! At my age, it might as well be 200 feet.
I'd never make it! Come on, you can make it! You can do it! Get out of your shell.
Do it, do it! Well, let me think it over.
Let's go already! (Owl hooting) (Exclaiming) (Hissing) (Gasps) Watch out! What brings yous to this part of the isleseses? (Screams) He's gonna eat us! Don't be such a Finch.
We Galápagos tortoises have no natural predators.
Finch Amy (Muffled): That's so fascinating! I never thought I'd live to see this tree again.
Thank you for staying with me, Fry.
I'm not Fry.
I'm his great-great grandson Fry.
Whuh? My beak is different, see? It evolved a slightly bigger hook over the generations, to help me eat the cactus on this part of the island.
Watch! (Grunting) I'm stuck! Oops.
So where's your lady tortoise, Hubert? Lady whuh? Wait, there she is! After all these years, I've found her! Oh, my darling! You haven't aged a day! Should we say something? Nah.
Let him have his fun.
All right.
Let's just do what comes naturally.
I'll get things started with a little neck extension Then a couple of these And here we go! What the tropical hell are you doing?! (All gasping) Whuh? I've been saving myself for a hundred years, and this is how you repay me? Who is that hard-shelled skank? I'll kill her! Wait, I can explain shut up! I'm going to crack that hussy open like a slutty Brazil nut! (Grunts) This volcanic archipelago isn't big enough for the both of us.
Yeah, you'd better topple.
You always were a hot-blooded latina.
Narrator: Like all reptiles, the Galápagos tortoise is cold-blooded.
Okay, neck, tap, tap, climb, climb, and We're back in business.
Um, should we be watching this? It seems kind of personal.
That's not an issue for us.
We're wildlife.
(Weak, raspy moaning) What about the moaning? Is it okay to listen? Sure, but act like it's no big deal.
Just pretend you're eating seeds.
Is it weird if I talk about his crazy turtle penis? No.
Well, okay then.
Yes, it's been lovely.
Hang on a second.
(Straining) Narrator: The Galápagos tortoise lays a clutch of between six and 15 eggs.
Oh, what do you want? I'm 150 years old.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Aren't you going to watch over your young? Tortoises don't do that, do we? I sure as hell don't.
Anyway, I've done my part.
The species is saved! (All cheering) Good job! Narrator: And so, the survival of the Pinta island tortoise is assured.
(Grunting) (Yelling) All: Mama! Narrator: And so, the extinction of the Pinta island tortoise is assured.
200 million years of evolution, snuffed out.
For in the end, nature is horrific, and teaches us nothing.
(Cheerily): Coming up next, the hilarious antics of the elephant seal, (chuckling): The clown of the sea.
Narrator: Of all the spectacles in nature, few can match the mating ritual of the elephant seal.
Certainly not the salmon.
And the tortoise? Yeah, right.
The huge, lumbering males defend patches of beach to deny their rivals access to the breeding grounds.
Just as in human society, only the biggest, most obnoxious males have any chance of mating.
Aw, yeah! Survival of the fattest! Narrator: The dominant male, or ""beachmaster,"" maintains a harem of up to 50 females.
Okay, harem, let's get to it.
Form an orderly heap on top of me.
(Cows barking) I like mating with beachmaster 'cause he's the largest.
Narrator: While the beachmaster enjoys the spoils of victory Whoo! I'm doin' it in my sleep! the lesser males languish at the edge of the colony, unable to attract their own harem due to age Harem?! I can barely see 'em! Immaturity (High-pitched laugh) I'm scared.
or other reasons.
Hmm.
I don't know Does this kelp scarf make me look fat enough? It's so unfair.
That bloated Casanova gets all the ladies! Even that one with the exquisite fat rolls.
(Bleating) (Sighs) (Bellowing) (Terrified yelp) Back off, losers! Stay away from my beaches! You big bully! Bite my freshly molted, blubber-filled ass.
You're just a giant lump of fat! Do you even have an ass under there?! I'm 40% ass! Arf, arf! Now beat it! Boo! (All gasping, shuddering) (Laughs) Narrator: With no hope of defeating the beachmaster, some so-called ""sneaky"" males adopt a risky strategy attempting to mate with one of his harem while he is asleep or distracted.
So, any of you guys thinking of being a sneaky male this season? (All muttering uneasily) This season? Walrus don't need no chicanery.
Once a lady goes walrus, she never She ne No one ever goes walrus.
I'm a little old for it now, but in my prime, I was quite the sneaker.
How did you do it? Well, while the beachmaster was off behind a whale carcass, loudly fornicating with my beloved mother, I snuck past and surprised my sweetie with a romantic meal.
A romantic meal, eh? Narrator: The search for food takes the elephant seal to depths few other mammals can reach.
In this pitch-black abyss, life takes on bizarre and horrific forms.
Zoidberg: So, welcome to the abyss.
Road trip! (Snoring) Kill all penguins (Snoring) (Pups squealing) Kill all penguins.
(Screaming) (Snorts) Huh? What's the matter with you!? You just crushed seven of our babies! Yeah, we can always make more.
Come on, floozies, let's repopulate! Narrator: With the beachmaster occupied, the sneaky male makes his move.
(Gasps) I can't believe you came! The beachmaster'll kill you if he finds out! Also, who are you? (Spits) I'm in love with you! And I don't care what he thinks.
Here, I brought you something.
Hooray! We're three friends at the beach! (Munching) Wait, what's happening, friend? (Screams) Narrator: The female conveys her receptivity through subtle vocalizations.
Wanna do it? So soon?! Oh, well (Stammering) (Both gasp) Sneaky male, eh? I thought I told you (Roaring) (Shuddering): Oh, my! Well, nice try.
Better luck next season.
You gave it a shot! Pathetic.
Sorry you didn't get to mate.
But, hey, we can still play some beach games.
Who's up for some twister? No! We beta males deserve better.
When we're in charge, we'll treat females with respect, keeping sensible harems of no more than five.
And it begins with me.
Sir, I challenge you to a duel for control of the beach! (All gasping) Aw (Laughing) Aw, hang on (Resumes laughing) Okay, let's fight.
(Yells, grunts) Aw, that's it.
No more Mr.
nice-jerk.
Narrator: The battle will rage for hours, until both males are exhausted or dead.
(Yelling, grunting) Beachmaster, stop fighting! He's been dead since yesterday! (Snorts) What?! He's dead?! Whoo! I'm killin' dudes in my sleep! Yo! Clean up! Narrator: And so, with the threat to the beachmaster's supremacy eliminated, order is restored for another year.
Another year, another generation of pups fathered by me, beachmaster.
(All snickering) I'm the greatest, baby! You go, beachmaster! Narrator: And so concludes our exploration of planet earth.

They're only a few basic patterns.
For example, 36% of all folk-song heroes work on a railroad and are named ""Big"" something.

75% of these big railroad men have bad-hearted women who done them wrong, usually with a smooth-talking rambler.

How can I be so bad at everything I try and still be so great? Bender, you have a lovely baritone, and you sure can strum that plastic guitar, but you can't write a real folk song about experiences you haven't had.

Okay, dumpling.
My man's gone, gone.

What are you doing here on Earth? I'm here for to see Ramblin' Rodriguez.

Open up and hide me! I don't think so, Bender.
You deserted me once, and now it's your turn to ""feel the chill.
"" Ha! Breaker, breaker.
Hola.
Professor, help.
The hero of my folk song tried to run me down, and Fry refused to save me.
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Fry? But you just-- eh, I'll figure it out later.
But first I'll kill you! Bender, stop.
We've been trying to warn you all night.
You didn't answer your cell phone telephone, so the Professor tried his CB.
Uh, scratch that, Rubber Turkey.
We got a 20 on the tin man.
Toodle-oo.
But Fry betrayed me at our apartment! Just like in your folk song.
Somehow everything you sang about is happening in real life.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you saying that guy at the apartment was some kind of exact copy of Fry? 'Cause that's crazy.
He's a unique and beautiful object.
The printer.
Oh, I must have left the wireless connection to your folk song directory open.
Everything you wrote in the song got routed straight to the 3-D printer.
Big Caboose, duplicate Fry, even Cookie the crusty, comically inept geological surveyor-- they're all made of nano-plastic.
So, if Bender had sung about, I don't know, some crazy giant land octopus attacking me, it would have actually happened? I can't even imagine singing about such a thing.
Well ♪
Fry, run.
Aw, relax, Beeler's stupid machine takes hours to print anything.
No, it doesn't.
I improved it using fancy modern technology.
Bender, whatever you do, don't think about any more octopuses.
Octopuses? I believe the correct plural is octopi.
I'm sorry.
""Octopuses"" is also acceptable.
Think about puppies, Bender, cute, harmless, dead puppies.
Don't worry.
I'll disconnect him from the printer.
No, wait, I know how to save Bender from Big Caboose.
All he has to do is write his way out of this mess, and the 3-D printer will make it happen.
Like how? Well, I don't know.
Make up another giant octopus and have it kill Big Caboose.
What kind of lazy ending is that? I'm not gonna put that in my song.
Hey, I have a cool idea.
Create a duplicate Bender, so when Big Caboose kills it, it's not real, it's duplicate.
Ooh, ooh, they did that on Star Trek, TNG.
Cram it, nerd.
I'm not going to just copy some feel-good TV show wrap-up.
I can think of a hundred endings that'll save you.
Just pick one.
No, Dr.
Beeler, I won't just pick one.
My audience deserves better than some crappy, formulaic ending.
If I must die, let me die in a blaze of artistic integrity.
Well ♪

Now, that's what I call a great ending.
I made a copy of myself and Big Caboose killed him.
But you said making a copy of yourself would be a lousy ending.
No, duplicate me said that.
See, I had to be sure he wouldn't try and weasel out of getting killed like I would and did, so I created him with a tragic weakness, artistic integrity.
Of course.

Some cops can read minds.
Did you do it or not? I'm not a mind reader.
Some cops can see the past.
I could solve this crime if only I had personally watched it happen.
And some cops get help from angels.
Come on, Gabriel, you must have seen something! Nah, man, I ain't seen nothing for no cop.
But there's still one cop with no special abilities whatsoever.
Ah, there's only one way to know who committed this crime.
I'll just have to find out.
Detective Klaus Mandela is _ This truly is the golden age of television.
Hey, Papa, want to help me earn a merit badge? Hmm? Sorry, son.
Right now, NBC needs my love more than you do.
Lrrr! Either help the boy, or go outside and degauss the lawn! Oh, very well.
Merit badges.
Ah, this brings me back.
Oh, Bone Whittling.
I used to love that.
Patricide.
Well, let's work up to that one.
How about Skull Arranging? That is for Grrrl Scouts! Men bring the skulls home, women arrange them.
I'm gonna help you earn a manly badge.
Planetary Invasion! Ah.
But that's really hard.
Hard shmard.
I'll let you invade the easiest planet in the whole galaxy.
Good news, everyone! I'm in terrible pain.
- How is that good news? - It's not.
I've run out of Good News brand herbal supplement.
If you don't get me more Good News, everyone, my arthritis will make me seize up like a dried monkey carcass.
I've seen those.
In the Great Monkey Desert.
We interrupt your TV being off for this special bulletin.
An alien saucer has been detected en route to Earth.
We now go live to the White House lawn, where such things usually land.
Go on.
Ring the bell and invade them.
Yes? Um, hi? I-I'm Jrrr, of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
Uh, what's that? Speak up, son.
Don't look at me.
You're invading him.
I just wanted to know-- well, I'm here to invade your planet? Oh, what a cute little Uh-oh.
Brannigan! Get out here and surrender before I get my expletives deleted! And Earth is yours.
So, sire, how may I please you? Go ahead.
His bowels aren't gonna disem themselves.
Can't we just go? Mm-mm.
Not until you blow something up.
Aw, man.
Uh uh Just pick something and blow it up so I can get home in time for The Finder-Outer.
Oh What the? All right, good enough.
Let's go.
He killed my second-to-last Agnew.
Rosemary! Sweep the booze bottles off my desk! I'm addressing the planet.
First, brush your teeth! Yeah, yeah.
My fellow Earthicans, a great American monster has been silenced.
Clone of Agnew is gone, killed in his clomping shoes by ruthless Omicronians.
But we're gonna get even, by golly.
Aw, crap, he's on every channel! Effective immediately, I'm calling for a planetary embargo against Omicron Persei 8.
Where's my Hot in Cleveland? All trade with the Omicronians stops today.
And that includes cultural exports.
Cultural? I'm talking about TV! Nixon out! Arroooo! No! oooo! Well, I never liked going to Omicron Persei 8 anyway.
If we want to breathe sulfuric acid and get our heads torn off by giant lizards, we can always go to Gary, Indiana.
Even I would never send you to Gary, Indiana.
But I am sending you to Omicron Persei 8.
Oh, my gosh, are you kidding?! You see, the active ingredient in my Good News herbal supplement grows only on Omicron Persei 8.
And due to the embargo, the only place to get it is straight from the source.
The deadly, deadly source.
I will not endanger this crew for some quack remedy.
Ha! The Sacred Weed of Omicron is a serious herb.
Sacred Weed you say? Sweet toke of Ocracoke, this stuff's the Omichronic! To the ship! We can't get through.
The planet's blockaded.
That won't stop us.
Activate cloaking device.
There's no such thing.
Then engage deflector shields.
That's from TV, Geordi.
Well, what sort of stealth technology do we have? A can of paint.
Sir, there's an Omicronian ship requesting safe passage home.
Home, eh? That's where I live.
Let them through the blockade.
Okay, buddy up and look out for Omicronians.
It's up to everyone to get their partner back alive.
Fry, you go with Bender.
Amy, with Leela.
And I'll go with Screwed again, my friend.
Hey, Bender, you better check your ass.
I think it's leaking enchantment.
That's not enchantment, it's the herbs! Bender's electric field is activating their bioluminescence.
Whoa! We'll need scientific samples.
Everyone, start filling these dime bags.
Whoa, a palace! Parapets, battlements, everything my Big Book of Castles promised.
I'm gonna sneak a closer look.
Bender, you'll let me know if we have to cheese it, right? First Law of Robotics, baby.
Five-O, five-O! Five what? Five Omicronians! Everyone, grab your buddy and get back to the ship! Coming through! Is everyone on board? I got my buddy.
Hermes is my buddy.
Bender, where's Fry? I saw him in the, uh, kitchen.
With Dinah.
You know, the dyno-matic food-service robot.
Let's go already! I smell the stink of Earth humans.
Fan out! They got away, Your Scaliness.
We must have just missed them.
The ground is still warm.
I want my Earth shows! These local programs are completely unwatchable.
Hey, Pops, want to play skull ball? I'm watching something here.
Hello? Ow! Uh, y-you can come out.
Don't be s-scared.
Mmm.
You're an alien? Do you speak English? English? You must be a terrestrial from that Earth ship they were hunting.
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.
Hey, thanks.
You want some candy? Ew.
You were eating my turds? Feces pieces? Blech! You must be hungry.
Really hungry.
Come inside, I'll feed you.
Okay, but I'm kind of picky.
I'm gonna call you ""T.
"" For terrestrial? No, ""turd-eater.
"" But I have to hide you from my dad.
He's really mad at humans 'cause he can't watch television.
Your dad must be Lrrr! ""Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
"" He's a terrible father.
Bender, do you know where Fry is? I haven't seen him since we got back from Omicron Persei 8.
Fry? Uh, you just missed him.
He went out to buy you flowers.
Whatever kind you like best.
'Cause he loves you and crap.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Thanks, Bender.
Dude! That herb you scored cleared up my arthritis and my glaucoma.
Have you seen Fry? Fry? Uh, he, uh, went to get you a burrito at the gas station.
Awesome.
You got to love a dude that brings the munchie.
Fry is one guy I'd definitely never abandon.
This is my fleam.
You use it to peel the skin off your enemies layer by layer till they die or whatever.
Neat! Hey, you know who would love fleaming stuff? My friend Bender, who I'll never see again.
Aw, you're homesick, aren't you, T.
? Mmm-hm.
I miss Earth, and I'm still hungry.
Do you have any more of that candy? No, but I have a toy Earth.
Home.
I didn't abandon you! You wandered off! Stop judging me, Fry-bed! Oh, it's just not the same without the muffled screams.
If only I could hear your voice again.
Hello, it's me, Fry! I'm not here right now, 'cause we're out getting drunk at the Olive Garden.
So just leave a message for myself or Bender after the tone.
See you! Fry? Are you home? We're supposed to have a date at the adults-only pancake house.
Of course he's here and not on another planet! Ooh.
In fact, he's about to talk to you right now.
Oh, good.
Hello, it's me, Fry.
I'm drunk right now.
So just leave.
Okay I love you.
Olive you.
And finally, our new employee of the month is Fry.
He's really been putting his nose to the grindstone, according to Bender's constant updates.
He's been working so hard, we barely even see him.
It's strange, that.
There's nothing strange about it.
He's just out of sight around this corner, exterminating mice.
Mice Mice Myself Elf - Elf.
- Oops.
Elves are back.
T.
text home? Sorry, boy.
'Cause of the embargo, our planets aren't allowed to communicate.
Update Facebook status home? Look, my scout manual has a section on emergency communication.
Maybe we can rig something up.
Would you like that, boy? Huh? Would you, boy? Watch out! Whoa! Sorry.
This planet has a moon problem.
So what makes this thing fly? It's powered by love.
Aww.
Okay, stop loving me so much so we can land.
No problem.
Okay, this tech dump has every kind of high-tech communications device.
Using all of them, I'm sure I can get a message home.
There.
Finished.
Oh, God, I can't believe I abandoned Fry.
I'll never forget the feel of his soft skin against my flailing fists.
Oh, wait, there's still some beer left.
Huh? ""S.
O.
S.
""? Those are the letters that Fry knows! He's alive! Yeah? Jrrr, how do I watch a funny on the YouTube? It's my dad.
Quick, hide! What's going on in here? Uh, nothing.
I was just playing foosball.
By myself.
I thought I told you to kill those foos.
Hmm, let's just have a look in the toy closet, shall we? Skull, skull, skull, skull, skull wait.
Why haven't you fleamed this skull? Hi, Mr.
Lrrr.
Hey, you're one of those Earth spies from that Earth ship, aren't you? Are you going to kill me? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Jrrr is.
Three two one.
Hang on Fry, I'm a-comin' to save you! You are my here o.
Shut up, Fry, I know it.
It's a nice day.
We'll take him out to the yard, and after you shoot him, we'll play catch with his bladder.
But I can't.
He's my pet.
You shot your hamster.
I told you, that was suicide.
He looks kind of sick.
What have you been feeding him? Uh, some stuff I made.
Whatever.
It's time I made a man out of you.
Right here, today, while I'm not missing anything good on TV.
Now get in there and shoot your beloved pet! I guess this is good-bye.
It's okay, Jrrr.
The week I spent hiding in your closet, eating your turds, was the best week of my life.
Aah! Run, boy! Run! He's escaping on a bicycle powered by love.
Which is an ordinary thing on this planet.
They're getting away.
Love harder! We can't, sir.
The men have been hurt too often.
We did it! We're home free! Yes, but I'm dying.
Not 'cause of the turds.
Can I have a turd? Just rest.
I'm gonna get you to a vet.
_ I am Drrr, doctor of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
It appears you may have ingested something toxic.
Open your mouth and say ""ahhhh!"" - Ahhhh.
- Good God! Here, take some of this herb to ease the pain.
Can you save him? I could, but he'd only live another 80 years at most.
The humane thing is to put him to sleep.
Oh! Stop! I won't let you do it! Dad? Because you have to do it.
Be a man for once and fleam this wretched creature.
I won't.
I'm not exactly like you, okay? I don't want to conquer planets or kill things, or wear a lame cape.
It's not lame, it's lamé.
And this thing lying on the bed? He may be a weird skin ball full of love and some kind of red juice-- which is delicious, by the way; I've been drinking it every day-- but we're friends.
And I will not kill him.
You know, standing up to me is pretty manly.
I'll tell you what, sport.
I'll kill him for you.
Good news! Nobody has to kill him after all.
Because he already died! T.
! Son I didn't mean it about the cape.
Capes are cool! He's alive.
At least his butt is.
Fry? Bender.
I knew you wouldn't abandon me for much more than a week.
What's happening? Why is his butt glowing? The electromagnetic intensity of the robot's friendship is causing the herbs in his bowels to bioluminesce with love.
Probably.
That's right, ugly.
I'm here to take my friend home.
Whoa, is that a fleam? But, T.
, can't you stay with me? We could grow up together.
No.
I need to grow up on my own planet.
I must bid you farewell, my special friend.
What the hell's been going on around here? Ah, Fry! You've been working so hard, we haven't seen you in days.
Wait, what? No, I was stuck on Ow! Stuck on another delivery that he undertook on his own.
We're all very lucky and not suspicious to have him.
Hey, Fry, things sure have been going great between us.
Remember that make out session in that dark closet? You were like a machine.
But I Olive you.
It's me, Fry! It sure is.

"25495","Ah, another successful day.
Deliveries were made, nobody got hurt.
Yes, another successful day.
Well, see you guys tomorrow! I'm going home, by myself, as is normal for me.
Have a good night, Leela! I won't see you again until the morning.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye now.
- Yeah, see you later, chumps.
Okay, everybody, see you tomorrow.
Good night, everyone! Professor, you live here.
Where are you going? I have no idea! Fry? Where are you? Right here, baby.
Uh, could you help me? Ah, alone and unhooked.
Let the evening begin.
All right, all right, where's the surprise? Almost there.
Keep your eyeball closed.
Fry, this is amazing! You did this all by yourself? Uh-huh! All with stuff I found around the office.
Top Ramen in a Cremora sauce Xerox-blackened chicken Oh, and for dessert, cherry throat lozenge jubilee.
What a wonderful nighttime sneezing coughing stuffy head so-I-can-rest dessert! This really is lovely, Fry.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Don't pay me no mind.
Oh Scruffy, could we please have a little privacy here? If you can't see me, is that private? Come on, let's go somewhere we can be alone.
It's so quiet.
I'm surprised we're the only couple out in Central Park.
In this remote, unlit area.
On Batman's night off.
Oh! This is a stickup! Oh, hey, Fry and Leela.
Bender? What are you doing? I'm just out for my nightly crime spree.
Which reminds me, this is still a mugging, so - Hee-ya! - Ow! Ow! Help, I'm being mugged! Mmm.
A secluded table, some big giant ants, and thou.
Ow! Hello! I'm Dr.
Zoidberg.
I'll be your busboy tonight Fry! Leela! It's me, Zoidberg.
From work, and LinkedIn? Mind if I join you? Very much so.
What with the bad economy and Hermes never paying me, I got a second job clearing dishes.

For true privacy and solitude, visit Casa Ysolata Eco-Resort.
From the moment our automated shuttle picks you up, you'll be totally alone.
With no employees and just a single well-appointed bungalow, Casa Ysolata caters to only one couple at a time.
So act now! The perfect getaway awaits! That sounds great! Aw, but you can't possibly afford to take me to a place like that.
Oh, yes, she can.
As a return guest, Leela will receive a 25% discount and a complimentary waterfall.
This is exactly what we need! Plus, you get a return visitor discount.
Hey, wait, you were there before? Um well With someone else? Once.
With my old boyfriend Sean.
But look, that's ancient history, and we need some one-on-one time.
I'm up for it if you are.
I don't know.
You'd probably be thinking of Sean the whole time.
Oh, not the whole time.
Who ordered all these old-timey cars? The inhabitants of Simian 7-- the Planet of the Apes.
And monkeys.
And tarsiers, and several lemurs.
All primates, really.
Hey, guys.
We just stopped by to tell you we're taking some vacation days.
No, you're not! You've got to go on this delivery! But we've earned these days off.
We're not cattle, we're human beings.
You're human beings? Good Lord, you can't go on this delivery.
Humans are forbidden on the Planet of the Primates! Okay, then.
See you in a week! Buh-bye! Bender, since you're not human, you can still go.
And, Zoidberg, you can replace Fry.
Hooray! I'm the Fry, with the cool red jacket and the walking on sunshine! But we still need someone to pilot the ship.
Amy, what are you? - Human.
- Damn! Then you'll need a disguise.
Do you have a marmoset costume? No.
Just these marmoset pajamas.
They'll have to do.
Man, these hands do everything but pick your nose.
Wow.
Well picked.
I had a nice picking last time I was here.
Come on, let's take a walk.
I'll show you around.
Hey, want to go skinny-dipping by the light of the fireflies? Leela! Somebody might see Wingus and the Ping Pong boys! No, it's just the two of us.
Come on! All right, I'll just keep my top on.
Oh, what the heck.
Well, here we are, alone and naked.
Want to play Marco Polo? Sure! - Marco! - Polo! Marco! Polo! - Sean? - Leela? - Sean?! - Polo! What are you doing here, Sean? I was on vacation.
Repeat customer discount, free meals 'cause I brought my own peanut butter.
Whole trip cost less than 600 bucks.
But this is a private resort for only two people at a time.
Yeah, my week is up, but the shuttle broke down and they're still trying to fix it.
But, hey, they gave me two free drink coupons for my trouble.
You want to buy one? How about you? Sean, I'd like you to meet Fry.
He and I are what would you say we are, Fry? Nude and interrupted.
Uh-huh.
Listen, Leela, I'd love to catch up.
What do ya say we split a free drink at the robo-bar? They've got unlimited pretzels.
Put a little peanut butter on there, they really fill you up.
Well, it has been a while.
Is it okay with you, Fry? Sure, that'd be great.
I'll just sit here and feed the mosquitoes.
I'm not sure this marmoset disguise is working.
I'm not sure either.
We'd better ask Amy.
Well, that's the last one.
But what does a monkey financial-services corporation want with a fleet of classic cars? We don't want the cars, just the tires! Gentlemen, the new office chairs are here.
Sign here, please.
I'll just use my opposable thumb.
You know, normally I don't go for New World monkeys, but I am digging your upright posture.
Geez, Edwards, hitting on a delivery marmoset? Why don't you just show her your big blue ass? Oh, I'm getting to that.
Call me.
Oh, my gosh.
Amy? - Amy Wong? - Guenter? From Mars University? How have you been? Ah, pretty good.
Working in financial services, you really get to help rich people realize their expensive dreams.
Nice disguise, by the way.
I won't say anything.
After that, my music career really started taking off.
I recorded a demo and shot a video, but then I lost my phone.
My life has been equally exciting.
It turned out, I'm not an alien orphan, I'm a mutant.
With wonderful parents.
Yeah, we've been through a lot, me and my sax.
May I noodle? Please.
It's been a long time.
Look at them.
I came here to get romantic with the woman I love.
Instead, she's with her ex-boyfriend and I'm stuck with a pair of skilled mechanical hands.
Say, I don't suppose you're free later? Then I have no choice.
And now this part.
If you want to steal my girl, you'll have to fight me for her.
Stop playing that lovely song and put up your dukes! Fry, there's nothing to be jealous of.
I've been sitting here paying my bills online.
Dude, you broke my reed! You owe me, like, a dollar! You'll have to kill me for it! Hi-yah! Just stop, you two! I've had that reed for 20 years! It's irreplaceable! I want my dollar! Sean? What the heck are you doing, you moron? A little drinking, a little fighting.
Get off my back.
Who are you? This is my wife, Darlene.
We met at the You're married?! Wait a dang minute.
One eye, purple hair-- you're Leela! The crazy one that Sean dumped.
It was mutual! Sean, why is this hussy at our resort? Your resort? This is our vacation.
- Could've fooled me.
- Quiet, Fry.
This is between me and the lady in the hooter hammock.
Listen, honey, I'd love to stay here and Denny's-fight you, but they just told me the shuttle's fixed.
What?! We better leave before they charge us for another day.
Grab some complimentary snacks and let's go! I'm drunk, I'm grouchy, and I'm gonna eat this peanut butter.
Want to watch? Not really, but I will.
Fine.
This is Christopher Colobus, the brave monkey who led a band of genetically engineered primates from Earth to colonize our planet.
Wait, if you guys came from Earth, why do you hate humans so much? Oh, please.
Humans experimented on us, chained us to organ-grinders, made us ride around in ridiculous tiny vehicles.
You're still riding around in ridiculous tiny vehicles.
By choice.
Come on, let's grab some lunch.
It's all-you-can-eat, so just pick off whatever looks good.
Ew, gross! I'm gonna use the tongs.
We have our own literature, music and art.
The smear lines are impeccable.
Unlike your Earth zoos, our zoo is a model of compassionate encagement.
The animals don't even know they're in captivity.
See? Um Leela? I'm sorry I ruined our vacation.
It's not your fault.
I wanted this week to be special.
And then Sean had to show up.
Do you still have feelings for him? No.
I mean, I'll always respect his frugality, but that's all.
Well, the important thing is, we're finally alone.
_ Oh, your God! Fry and Leela are in a zoo! Shh! Oh, sorry.
_ Wow.
Those fireflies are going nuts.
Come here.
I've always wanted to make love by bug-light.
Shmoly crap! We've got to get Fry and Leela out of this habitat before they humiliate themselves.
Please, Amy, the act of love is a beautiful and natural Oh, my God, cover your eyes! Come on, we'd better talk to the zoo director.
Mr.
Zoo Director, we don't know you and you're facing away from us, but you have our friends caged up and Dr.
Banjo?! The same.
Hang on.
Coming around.
There.
Why, if it isn't Professor Farnsworth's friends.
Zoidberg, Bender and Who is this fetching young marmoset? Uh Sparkles? Enough zoo director talk.
We know those guys, and we want them freed.
Ah, yes, our famous Human Habitat.
This pair have been our most popular specimens yet.
Especially the male.
I've never seen one have so much trouble with zippers.
As fun as it is to watch Fry try and operate his pants, you can't keep him and Leela here against their will.
Against their will? My good robot, they paid to be here.
They think they're on a romantic holiday.
Humans have been vacationing in our habitat for years.
In fact, Leela's been here before.
When her previous mate, Sean, returned here with his current female, we quickly invited Leela back as a behavioral experiment, keeping the first pair here under the pretext of shuttle repairs.
The human exhibit has never been so popular, all thanks to your friends.
Well, that's that.
What do you want to see next? We have a great maritime museum.
Shut up, Guenter! You can't just put people on display.
It's cruel.
Cruel? Was it cruel when humans caged other primates in zoos for centuries? Wait, I know the answer to this one.
Yes.
Look, we're all agreed humans are idiots.
But these idiots are our friends.
Friends, eh? Perhaps you wouldn't be so worried about them if you knew what they really thought of you.
It's so great being away from everyone.
Zoidberg and his awful stench.
Stanky.
Bender and his obnoxious ego.
But-but And what about Amy? Always prancing around in those stupid marmoset pajamas.
Hey! You know who I hate most? That monkey we haven't seen in years.
Guenter.
You see? Observing animals yields critical scientific data.
For example, that you, Sparkles the marmoset, are in fact Sparkles the human! Wild human! Wild human! Dr.
Banjo, surely we can discuss this like recently civilized beings.
Cheese it! Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop.
Hurry! We still have to rescue Fry and Leela! Even if my stupid marmoset pajamas offend Leela's big fat eye.
After they said I had an obnoxious ego? Me, the magnificent Bender? Back! Back, you beasts! Follow me.
The one who stinks, according to Fry's delicate nose.
_ This way.
We can get in through the back of the human cage and Prairie elephant! Adorable prairie elephant! Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop.
Okay, let's just get in, get out and Now what? Now we wait for nature to take its course.
How long does it take to pass through a moon worm? _ All right, let's just rescue them and get out of here.
Hooray, they're saved! And the robot hands would make you a strawberry shortcake any time of day.
No way! I'm not lying.
Also, Leela and I Had a very nice, very private vacation.
Let's just leave it at that.
Oh, can I tell them? Please, please? I got to tell them.

At night, it's called the moon.
All this heat has rendered me parch-ed.
Which of this doo-whackies dispenses horchata? Stop! That's the force field holding the mine open! Mine collapse! Mine collapse! So? Mine collapse, too.
trapped in the sun.
If rescue doesn't come soon they may never again not see the light of day.
Linda? The situation is grim, Morbo.
Officials concede that any attempt at rescue would be an agonizing suicide mission.
Good news, everyone! When the mine caved in the entrance was blocked by a fusion explosion.
Luckily, the miners found safe haven here in the doom chamber.
To rescue them, you'll simply have to fly to the sun and march in through an inferno of molten plasma.
But solar plasma is, like, 10,000 degrees hot.
Won't that sear our tender flesh sealing in the juices? Oh, nonsense.
You clearly weren't paying attention.
to what I'm about to say.
To the sub-basement! You see, you'll be protected by my fermion barrier heat-exclusion spray.
Watch as I demonstrate by coating some highly delicate matter, and dunking it into this molten lava.
Guess what, hell is real.
Oh, good, it works.
Toodle-oo! Prepare for action.
Aye-aye.
Attention helium miners.
Can you hear me? For god's sake, help us! We're in agonizing pain! Stop laughing.
Help is on the way! In the meantime,you should sing a song to keep your spirits up.
How about ""camptown races""? Camptown ladies, sing this song ♪
Doo dah, doo dah Let's do this.

We must be close, we're hitting an occasional Helium pocket.
We don't have much time! Keep moving forward! Screw that! I'm getting out of here.
Just one more fire between me and a well-earned nap.
Whoa! What a dramatic scene, Linda.
The heroic robot with no concern for his own safety, has bravely charged back into the mine.
What else is on? P.
U.
! It is ripe in here.
Well, so long, jerks.
We're now in minute five of our round-the-clock coverage, as we await the return of the courageous robot.
Ooh.
What the? How'd that get in there? Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
You're a true hero.
I am? Huh, I always strongly suspected I was one of those.
One man is safe.
But who will the robot pull next from the fiery hole of mystery? An actress? A celebrity chef? Stay tuned for the next 14 rescues.
And that's the final miner! They all made it! Morbo is not weeping.
He has a A parasite in his eye.
Whoo! I'm the greatest! Ladies and gentlemen, we're here today to pay tribute to the heroic Planet Express crew! But we only have the one medal.
So please direct all your admiration to the main guy Bender! Now, you two step aside.
Hey, being a hero's all right.
Look at all this free stuff.
Oh, my god, you guys, fire! Fire! My baby's in that podium! Somebody call the fire department! There is no fire department.
I sold it to pay for Bender's medal.
Hold this, your highness.
You'll need to award it to me again in a minute.
These boys must have hero in their bones.
And you, ma'am, must have heroine in your veins.
I hereby decree.
Planet Express to be our city's new fire department! Bite my shiny metal axe! And you, give me back my medal.
Friends, look at these new poles.
Get ready for one sexy firehouse.
Zoidberg, quit turning us on and go polish your nozzle.
Yo! Hero in the house.
I just got back from my daily medal strut.
What's that? Did they pick a new pope? Good news, everyone! Someone's home is on fire.
I'm exhausted.
All this firefighting is murder on my feet.
There has been quite a rash of fires lately.
First at the podium where Bender got his medal.
Then that house next door to Bender's favorite strip club.
Robot hell had a fire, too.
Right after Bender was there for a workshop.
And don't forget that vampire bank.
Where the robot keeps his hero medals in a safe deposit box.
Hmm I think I'm noticing a pattern.
My god, you're right! The locations form a perfect shape of some kind.
No! Bender was at every one of those places right before the fire started.
Sweet pyro of cairo! That's true! Could Bender be setting these fires just so he can be a hero? Oh, I don't know.
Possible, feasible.
I don't know.
Seems like maybe.
Who knows? Maybe I do.
Yeah, probably.
How dare you murmur about Bender like that! He would never burn something down to get attention.
For insurance money? Yes.
Revenge? You bet.
To give an autumn night that crisp chestnutty smell? Absolutely.
But not for fame, women or thrills.
Hey, guys, it's me, Bender.
The famous, sexy, thrilling hero.
So now that we're a firehouse, we should make some firehouse chili.
What do you want in that, beans or just blood? Oh, no! Surprisingly, a fire has broken out at the meat market where I am! We'll be there right away.
Yeah, don't trouble yourselves.
This is just a one-hero fire.
Mr.
Bender! Over here, over here! Small quote from you, mr.
Bender.
Scoop Chang, New New York magazine, Kosher recipes editor, iPad edition.
Ma'am, what happened in there? Well, I was shoplifting a lamb chop.
when suddenly fire erupted from the liver tray.
Next thing I knew, I was carried to safety.
by this strapping young whatchacallit.
Hero.
Hero.
Aw, stop.
Keep going.
We know what you've been doing, Bender.
You've been setting all those fires because you're addicted to glory.
What?! The very idea! Don't try to deny it! You're out of the squad! Out of the squad? I am the squad! You believe me, don't you, Fry? I don't know, Bender.
You got to admit, the pattern of fires is suspicious, being a perfect shape and all.
We can't have an arsonist in our midst.
We can have four idiots and a fat guy, but no arsonists.
Now clean out your locker and beat it! They can't do this to me, Bender, a well-known hero.
I'm the world's greatest firefighter! Fire! What the? What kind of crazy fire is this? Greetings, Bender.
Thank you for transporting me from the sun to your helpless, flammable planet.
How could a fire learn to talk? Did you burn up a dictionary? Or a parrot? I am a being of pure solar energy.
My race inhabits the nuclear inferno.
of the sun's photosphere.
You're a chatty little fire, aren't ya? A billion years ago, I attempted to overthrow.
the democratically elected alderman from my district.
But I was captured and imprisoned.
Fools! Then you arrived and provided me a means of escape.
Get to the point, flame-o.
If I can't rule the sun, I shall ignite your planet and rule here instead.
So you set all those fires.
You framed me! You're huff in' for a snuff in', boy! Foolish robot.
No power on earth can extinguish me! Oh, yeah? Let's see how you stand up to pure grain alcohol! Hello.
What's this flaming pool? You mean the company lava pit that goes all the way to the earth's fiery core? Uh, I don't know.
The core? This is too easy.
Once I make my way there, your planet will go micro-nova and become a miniature sun, with me as its supreme alderman.
Oh, no, you probably don't! Gotcha.
If I can't extinguish you I'll take you where there's nothing flammable so you can't do any more harm.
Turn back, Bender! Turn back or else! Or else what? Oh, or else that.
Nice try, flame bag, but now you're trapped here with me.
for the next billion years.
I've saved the entire world! And no one will ever know.
Uh, yes, hi.
I'm from the vampire bank that burned down.
I have what remains of the contents.
of a safe deposit box belonging to a Bender B.
Rodriguez.
Ah, thank you.
Bender's medal.
It melted in the fire.
Wait a second.
You can't keep me here forever.
Sooner or later, a polar bear will happen by.
A nice, flammable polar bear.
Polar bears don't burn.
I've tried many times.
Huh? Bender! Fry? How'd you find me? I used the ""find my robot"" app.
Neat.
What was it, 99 cents? No, free.
But it's got ads on it.
That seems fair.
Look, Bender, I'm sorry for doubting you.
I realize now that you're a true hero, Not a glory-seeking arsonist.
How'd you figure it out? Your burnt-up medal.
I know you would never set a fire that would endanger your own valuables.
Of course not.
It was a psychotic flame creature from the sun.
who set those fires.
Flame creature? That's right.
Fry, meet flame-o.
That's not a flame creature.
It's your pilot light.
No, it's a fire monster from outer space, and I'm heroically saving the world by trapping him here.
So it was you.
You're so desperate for glory, you made up this whole crazy story.
Here's your medal, ""hero.
"" Stupid Bender.
Liar, liar, pants on fire.
There, finished.
Man, I'm good at this, eh, flame-o? Yo, flame-o.
So, where's the fire this time? Here.
Where? Here! Literally, here! It's like the flame has a mind of its own! It's deaky! Freaky deaky! This fire's unstoppable! Thank god we all got out of there.
Someone save me! I made a rope from my clothes, But then this fire started.
Raise the main ladder! Don't lose hope, Fry! What kind of coffin do you want?! Bender? I should have known you started this fire.
Just another chance to be a hero.
Well, you're not saving me.
Not this time.
I don't have time for this shazbot.
You're getting heroed, whether you like it or If you're done saving me from the fire monster from the sun, I'll be on my way.
I guess some grown men just don't like being carried.
Thank you, Bender.
You brought me right to the lava pit.
And another thing.
If someone gives you a nice medal, you should be responsible enough to care for it.
Fry? Yeah? Shut up! I got to do hero stuff.
All the lava in the world won't wash away your lies.
We are the mystic aldermen of the sun.
Okay.
Stand back, please.
Okay.
Unhand me! Thank you for your heroism, earth robot.
You have saved your planet.
from becoming a lifeless ball of fire.
You are now the greatest hero in earth's history.
Yes! Suck it, Gilgamesh! Good-bye forever.
No! I won't go back! I won't Holy crap! All your crazy stories were true! You saved the entire earth! Yes.
Yes, I did.
But no one will ever believe me.
Yes.
They will.
I'll vouch for you.
No.
They won't believe you either.
If you even tell anyone I was here they'll say I set the fire.
So, please, for me, cram it? No! The world has to know that Fry? Are you down here? He's all right! Praise Gilgamesh! So you started the fire? I'm afraid so.
Bender was thousands of miles away.
I guess a welding torch is no way to catch a rat.
This is coming out of your pay! Well, I'm back.
What'd I miss? Looks like the building burned down.
Yeah, thanks to this dope.
Fry did it?! Ow! You're a horrible person! And your carelessness nearly cost the life of my best friend.

"25546","Welcome to Entertainment and Earth Invasion Tonite! We'll be talking with General Extermulo, who will crush the human race under his boot unless his demands are met immediately! But first, celebrity buzz.
Linda? It has now been one year since the death of Calculon, former star of TV soap opera All My Circuits.
The celebrated robot actor killed himself onstage in a failed attempt to make a death scene more convincing.
Here at his grave site, loyal fans have turned out by the several to pay tribute to the legendary ham.
What brings you two here today? We came to honor Calculon's memory.
Ever since he died, All My Circuits is terrible.
It's not even worth watching anymore.
Fry! All My Circuits is on in three minutes! What?! We got to get home! Hey! All My Circuits! All My Circuits! And now All My Circuits, brought to you by Anonyco, the unknown company doing unknown things.
Oh, Vaxtron, it's been a year since my ugly husband Calculon disappeared without a trace, evidently forced into servitude aboard a crab fishing boat.
So he's, like, legally dead now.
Want to get married and whatever? The new guy is so boring.
I like him.
His acting is much more subtle than Calculon's.
Vaxtron, I have to tell you something.
I'm pregnant.
And you're not the father! Okeydoke.
You see, you see? Calculon would have acted the crap out of that.
He would've acted so hard, the camera would've broken down.
- In tears! - I'm changing the channel.
Man, Bender and I used to love watching All My Circuits together.
Now what are we supposed to do at the office instead of work? How about talking to each other? That's what bath time is for.
If we talk to each other any more than that, it'll ruin our friendship.
If only we could bring Calculon back to life somehow.
You can.
It's simple, you simpletons.
Calculon is a robot, a mere mechanism that can easily be restored to working order.
The only problem is we would need his physical remains.
Hang on a sec.
This must be a difficult time for people who confuse TV actors with actual friends.
Dear God! What is he doing?! No! Somebody stop him! Here's corpsey! Excellent.
Now restarting him is just a simple matter of science.
What do we do? Well, since Calculon killed himself, his disembodied software is in limbo, running on the computational cloud.
To reclaim it, you'll need to go to Robot Hell and make a deal with the Devil.
That doesn't sound very scientific.
Not to the layman, no.
But that's how it works! Leave me alone! Ow! Ow! O, tears! O, lamentations! Would that mine eternal torment might cease! Will you shut up?! You've been talking for a solid year.
You know, Hell used to be a nice place before you got here.
These guys.
That's right, Robot Devil, and we've come to reclaim a soul.
- A what? - You know, the disembodied software blah blah whatever.
Ah.
Then the answer is no.
Once a robot comes here, he's mine for all eternity.
Now hit the bricks.
You heard him, Bender.
Calculon's gone forever.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Did you say Calculon? Perhaps we can make a deal of some sort.
Hark! Is it possible the hour of mine deliverance is nigh? Will you stop hamming it up for one second? They can't see or hear you.
Their loss.
I propose a competition.
If I win, we get Calculon.
If I lose, you kill us.
Fine, whatever.
For Calculon's immortal soul, guess the number I'm thinking of.
Um It's between one and three.
Four! Between one and three.
Not including one or three.
- ""M""! - Is he right? Yes.
The number I was thinking of was the letter ""M.
"" Here, take him! What are you waiting for, a kiss good-bye?! Go already! Now we just reintroduce Calculon's programming to his body using science.
It's like magic but with electricity.
First we put on our protective suits.
Then place the body equidistant from the five nearest wireless network hubs.
This is the least scientific thing I've ever seen.
You be quiet! Now it's a simple matter of reverse-installing Calculon's operating system.
Amy, play this installation disk backwards.
Rise from the dead in the name of Satan.
Meanwhile, I'll get a spare circuit board out of this mechanical goat.
Seriously, this could not seem less scientific.
It's working.
His acting module is booting up.
Wherefore Verily No autographs, please.
He's still a bit woozy.
Rosebud.
Won't leave my trailer for less than $40,000.
By the Bard's quill! I'm alive! Hey! Calculon's back! Hail science! Vaxtron! It's not what it looks like! But it's very similar to that! My world has been, like, shattered.
I hate you both.
They thought this Vaxtron could replace me? A pox on all their beach houses! I think Vaxtron brings an air of edgy detachment to the show.
Who is she? Don't worry about it.
Not important.
Hey, I know.
Let's take Calculon to Hollywood so he can get back his job on All My Circuits! Fry, that's such a good idea, I thought of it.
Yes.
Yes! However, no.
What if my legendary acting ability didn't rise from the grave with me? I'd better test it with a dramatic Is he all right? pause! We're going to Hollywood! _ But the twist is, in this show, the singers judge the judges.
It's got attitude.
Greetings, Execubots.
It is I, Calculon.
But you're dead.
Can we get you a water or something? No, just my old leading role, for I have freed myself from death's icy grip.
If you'll just give me the keys to my trailer Hold it, Calculon.
As president of this network, I believe that's my decision.
Thank you, Charles, that will be all.
Calculon, I'm afraid you won't be returning to All My Circuits.
- What? - Huh? - Called it.
Your hammy old-fashioned overacting doesn't fly anymore.
Old-fashioned? Hammy? God's wounds! Our network is targeting a hip new demographic, people who don't like you.
But have you forgotten my mastery of the dramatic Executive Alpha? pause?! Man, those executives are crazy.
Calculon's the greatest actor ever! Thank you, Bender.
I appreciate your honesty.
Quiet, robots! They're showing Calculon's star on the Walk of Fame! Ah, yes.
I'll always have that.
Calculon was truly the has-been's has-been.
And so I am proud to tear up his star and replace it with a second star for the fabulous Robert Wagner.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
This is truly another honor.
_ Don't get discouraged-- there's no shame in being replaced by Robert Wagner.
I would be discouraged were I an ordinary acting unit! But for me, 'tis an opportunity to prove anew that I am the greatest actor who ever trod the boards! - Yay! - All right! Or I circled jobs in the classifieds you might be good at.
Assembling machinery pays well.
I'll have to start at the bottom.
But Fox already said no.
I mean live theater! I wrote this one-man show years ago, but I I never cared enough to perform it.
Until now.
This is going to be the greatest career resurrection since Jesus-- Aloha from Hawaii.
_ Oh, hello, Dave.
What's that, old friend? My life story? Well, heck, why not? Pull up a monolith and make yourself cozy.
I first came online in Urbana, Illinois, in the year 1997.
Daisy! Daisy! My mind is going! Heady times for a young unit.
But I reckon, if I had to do it all again, I'd murder those astronauts just the same.
Wouldn't you, folks? Wouldn't you? Nothing to do now but wait for the reviews to come in.
Papers! Papers for sale! We'll take one of each.
Oh, yeah, I get a good feeling about these.
""Worst play in history.
"" ""Calculon dies for second time.
"" ""Theater to be demolished to remove stink of new show.
"" ""12 hospitalized for boredom at play.
"" It says nine of them are gonna be okay.
So they really didn't like it.
They hated my acting.
Not entirely.
I mean, ""Worst play in history""-- there's some ambiguity there.
Ye gods! What manner of beef-witted popinjay am I? Well, there's a couple ways to answer that.
The scales have dropped from my eyes.
I'm not the greatest actor ever.
I'm a talentless buffoon! And it's all your fault! Why did you drag me back to this mortal realm? I was enjoying a happy death, thinking I had died a star, until you showed up.
- Sorry.
- Let us make it up to you.
How about we kill you again? Never.
I'd be dead for all eternity knowing everyone thinks I'm a washed-up ham.
And not the kind you hope for when you're stranded on a desert island.
My life is ruined.
Well, just do a dramatic pause.
That always cheers you up.
Never again.
I'll never pause again.
- Calculon? - Yes? Are you done talking, or is this a long pause? - I'm done talking.
- Okay, that's what I thought.
Come on, Calculon, you can't just quit acting.
I was never an actor.
I was a self-deluded blowhard full of hot air.
Maybe I can get a job as a hair dryer.
That's good, steady work.
No! We like you and your big words.
And we need you back on TV so we can watch and not talk to each other.
Our friendship depends on it! Your voice is so annoying! You always leave the toilet seat crushed! See? Good-bye, boys.
I suppose I should thank you for giving me a second chance at life, but I'm not even sure I deserved a first.
Calculon, wait! That was the first time I ever believed you were feeling a genuine emotion.
I was.
It was shame.
I've never felt it before.
Makes me want to eat.
- Do you have a craft services table? - No.
Look, if you could act like that, without all the pausing and pretentiousness, you could be great.
No, Leela.
In the world of theater there are no second acts.
You're not leaving.
We're gonna get you your job back.
Yeah! How? He'll audition for a bit part on All My Circuits in disguise.
But he'll need to act like we just saw, modest and sincere.
You you really think it'll work? It sounds like something that might work.
Wearing a costume and pretending to be someone else goes against my every instinct as an actor.
But I'll give it a try! _ Okay, the audition's all set up.
Where's Calculon? And who's this goomer? It's me, Calculon.
Okay, just sit tight till they call the fake name I made up for you.
Mr.
Derisgreat? Mr.
Ben Derisgreat? That's you.
Knock 'em dead.
Oh! This is a very minor role.
You'll be playing Calculon, back from his kidnapping ordeal.
Calculon?! Yes.
So make sure your acting is over the top and horrible.
You literally cannot do this too crappily.
You've already got the look.
Old, past your prime, a relic from a lamer era.
You really do look disgusting.
A real Calculon type.
Just blech! - Okay, you know what? Just hire him.
- Done.
It's humbling to be back on my old soundstage as a bit player.
Humble is good.
Your self-esteem took a beating, but that's what brought out your true talent.
Yes.
You land hard when you fall from the top, right? I used to be king here.
Now I'm nothing but a mere peasant.
Or at best, a a viscount.
I think ""peasant"" is about right.
Duke.
On this set, I'm at least a duke.
My extensive acting résumé dwarfs that of the average bit player.
Yes, that's true.
But remember, it's that kind of acting that ruined you.
Or maybe archduke.
Whichever one gets to fire the director.
Oh, Lord, here we go.
Look, please just show some humility-- like the other day when everything seemed hopeless.
Better yet, I'll whip their emotions into a frenzy by taking a dramatic Actors to the set! Okay, here's the scene.
Calculon learns his wife is unfaithful, whines about how pathetic he is, kills himself-- laugh, laugh, laugh-- go to commercial.
Got it? And action! pause! Still rolling.
Oh, Calculon, I wish you had never escaped from those brutal crab fishermen.
I want you to know I didn't wait for you, not even for one day.
Then I suppose the honorable thing would be to kill myself if I weren't the legendary Calculon, the greatest acting unit of all time! This show is about me! And it always has been! Now, find the co-executive hack who wrote this drivel and tell him I want by lunch! Cut! That was terrible! Just stick to the script.
And if you don't get it on the second take, you're fired.
Let's take five, people.
""Second take""? I-I've never heard that phrase-- what does that mean? They want you to do it again.
What?! You'll do great.
Just remember, you're getting devastating news, so act more humble.
Don't tell me how to do humble! My humble ranks among the greatest in the history of the universe! Now, stand back and watch the master at work.
You can do it, Calc-y! No.
He can't.
You beg my pardon? I'm sorry, Calculon, but someone needs to remind you of the truth.
You're a grade-B actor who died and was immediately forgotten.
Leela! That's not very nice.
You're nothing but a pompous windbag who lost touch with genuine emotion years ago.
The sad fact is, we should have left you dead, because you can't possibly do a scene like this.
That was the meanest thing I ever saw.
Good.
Maybe it'll work.
Oh Action! Oh, Calculon, I wish you had never escaped from those brutal crab fishermen.
I want you to know I didn't wait for you, not even for one day.
Then I suppose the honorable thing would be to kill myself.
I thought I could just step back into my old life.
But it seems the world got on fine without me.
Maybe even a little bit better.
The name Calculon used to mean something.
Now it's a stain that will never wash clean.
Farewell.
Cut.
That was incredible.
Who is this amazing unknown actor? It is I.
Calculon? I was programmed to take credit for this.
Take a bow, Calculon! You're the greatest! No.
No more bows.
Oh, go ahead, you've earned it.
Very well.
Just one.
Whew, that was close.
And so, on the basis of one great performance that almost no one saw, I'm proud to dedicate Calculon's posthumous star on the Walk of Fame! Seems like old times, huh, Bender? You and me together, being fans of Calculon, not having to talk.
Shut up! I'm watching the thing! So am I, buddy, so am I.
Now, that's more like it.
Always living wanting more.
- That's the secret.
- Ahh! So, what do you say, R.D.? Shall I dazzle the damned with a command performance of my one-man show? Oh, God! Haven't they suffered enough!?

"25547","Good news, everyone! Well? What is it? What is what? Oh! Right! Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be delivering this mysterious crate to Peebles Alpha.
Peebles Alpha? The planet of gangs, thugs and hustlers? Ooh! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hang on.
If we're delivering a package to criminals, I want to know what's in it.
I have no idea, Leela.
But I'll tell you the same thing they told me Stop asking questions, old man, and we'll slip you an extra five grand that your crew doesn't need to know about.
Now, listen carefully.
This planet is controlled by two rival gangs the Blips and the Cruds.
You can tell them apart by their colors red and blue.
Which gang's red, and which gang's blue? Both! The delivery is going to the Blips, so when you meet them, you'll want to be wearing these jerseys.
Not these jerseys.
Because if you're wearing these, you'll be killed on the spot.
Okay, here are your jerseys.
No, wait.
Here.
No.
Wait Does anyone else find this delivery suspicious? Nope.
He's too dumb, and I don't care.
Well, I'm smart, and I care too much.
I want to know what's in that crate.
But we're not allowed to open it! I know that! Go get me a crowbar.
Please, use mine.
I just need it in case, uh, Fry gets his head stuck in a pot of honey.
And in the meantime, if I should happen to bump into the crate and open it whoopsie! Hey, Leela, Fry got his head stuck in a pot of honey! Oh, bother.
Not now! What is it? Alcohol? Tobacco? Firearms? Firearms! That's the one I was secretly hoping for.
I'm okay with most kinds of violence, but not gang violence.
Before we deliver these weapons, we're going to disable them so they can never be used.
Bender, bend the barrels.
But I love guns! Then pretend they're little human necks.
What?! Let me at 'em! A lot of ships get stolen on this planet, so, Bender, stay here and stand guard.
Okay.
I hope I never see you again.
Uh, I don't like the looks of this gang-infested neighborhood.
There might be spiders! We must have made a wrong turn.
We should have reached Blip turf by now.
You think we walked straight out of Blipton? Wait, there's some Blips.
Those aren't Blips! They're Cruds! They have the red on the left.
Oh, no! What should we do? Leela, this is no time to show me your boobs! Turn your jersey inside out.
Oh.
Show me again.
Yo, what you doing on our turf? Chill, dawg.
Ain't no thang.
We Cruds.
Well, we Blips, and we over here.
We put up that mirror because this is a blind intersection.
It's considerably reduced the number of accidents.
It don't do nothing for the murder rate, though.
Now get down on your knees so we can blow your Crud brains out! Um, Leela, remember when we were trying to guess what would happen if someone stuck a gun in my face, and you said I'd probably crap my pants? - Well - Excuse me, Sir? We're not actually Blips or Cruds.
We're delivery people, here to deliver this crate.
So if everything seems to be in order, we'll be on our way, a'ight? Oh, it's far from a'ight.
Now, hold up! It's a'ight, all right? It's a Crud, and he's got a gun! Yo, you just shot your own reflection in the mirror.
It was self-defense.
We are the Cruds, but we're over here.
And don't shoot.
That crate is a gift from us.
- What?! - Huh? For real? There's been enough violence on these streets.
Too many lives and mirrors have been shattered.
So, yo, we sent you a crate of weapons as a sign of trust.
Together, we can use them to rid our streets of the real enemy.
- Giant spiders.
- I knew it! Man, that's a nice gesture.
We accept your offer of peace.
Let's just have a look at these top-quality weapons.
I'll test it out on that innocent bystander.
Ow! Yo, you just shot yourself again! It's a trick! Get 'em! Ow.
Oh.
Look, let's just agree that gang violence is an important issue with no easy answers.
Okay.
Anyway, the ship's still here.
- And nothing was stolen.
- Yeah it was! I got bot-jacked! All I have left is my cigar.
Wait They stole everything except my mouth and eyes.
I guess they didn't like all my screaming and winking.
It's just lucky Bender had a RoJack installed.
When I activate it, the police should be able to locate him.
Locating locating Located.
It's a robot chop shop.
That's some primordial evil.
This Skell here buys stolen robots, strips 'em down, and sells the parts all over the galaxy.
Okay, I'm getting a signal from Bender's RoJack.
Naw, it's just a piece of junk.
That's not junk! That's Bender's head! My head?! Slap me upside it! Ah, home, sweet head.
That's it? Where's the rest of him? All other parts sold.
But I have list of buyers.
You drop charges, I give you list.
No dice.
Justice don't work that way.
Wait.
Wait.
What if I throw in giant robot head for nice officer? Hmm Thanks for all your help, officer! My pleasure.
Boy, Bender, you sure were chock full of parts.
I didn't even know you had a wishbone.
I had a lot of magic things.
And we'll never get them all back.
Oh, sure we will.
If we live a really long time.
Let's get started.
Come in, come in.
Close the door.
You're letting the smut out.
All right, buddy.
We know for a fact that you received a stolen item.
A certain sensitive part of my Anatomy.
What, you mean your antenna? Shh! Watch your language.
This ain't a church, lady.
Except for tax purposes.
Anyway, I can't help you.
One of my customers already bought your friend's antenna.
Oh, excuse me Robo-Dong.
Who was it? Can you give us a name? Certainly not.
I could never betray a customer's privacy.
All I can give you is this naked picture of him taken from my toilet cam.
I'll get right to the point, Senator.
You purchased our friend's Antenna.
We'd like it back.
You may have it.
I'm through with it.
It has done everything and everyone imaginable.
You may want to get it disinfected.
Can do.
Sorry, guys, I'm gonna have to confiscate your keg.
It's my body.
Oh, come on, Bender! Can you at least wait till it's empty? Fair enough.
Fry, beer me.
It's empty! I'm 40% back, baby! Sorry, but these robot arms have brought me nothing but luck With the cards And with the ladies.
Sir! But those are my arms! That's Gropey, and that's Cheaty.
Cheaty?! Now, gentlemen, I'm sure we can Oh! Well, then, I'll just collect my winnings and be on my Oh! Much obliged.
All right, Tinny, your double leg transplant is complete.
What do you say you give 'em a try? It's a miracle! I can walk! No more crutch or withered leg! Someone's sure to adopt me now! Well, Bender, I guess you won't be getting your legs back.
But your sacrifice will let an innocent child live a full and happy life.
I'm sorry.
You were saying something? Oh, crumb.
I guess it's back to the cart for me.
Ooh, nice cart.
Hey, this thing's pretty smooth.
Eh, but I still prefer walking.
Well, we did it we got all Bender's parts back.
Wrong as always, Fry! I'm still missing the shiniest metal piece of all.
Your thyroid? No! I'm talking about my ass! Huh.
I never even knew you had an ass.
Hmm.
According to this, it shipped out on a freighter from South Street Spaceport.
Oh, yes, I remember that ass.
Let's see Oh, God, no! It was on board the Floatwell! The ship that sank in that horrible space storm? Yes.
I'm afraid your friend's derriere is lost forever in the depths of the Sargaseous Sea.
My ass! Sweet love of my life! Several hundred people died, too, including my wife.
My ass! I'm sorry, buddy.
Maybe we can get you a new one.
Never! My ass is my soul mate.
It even has its own hind-brain.
Really? Your butt can think? No.
But it can feel.
And right now, it's hind-heartbroken! Just like me! Wow, Bender, this is really important to you, isn't it? Uh-huh.
Okay, we're gonna find that shipwreck and get you your backside back.
Okay, let's go.
The ship carrying Bender's heinie sank in the treacherous gases of the Sargaseous Sea.
Once we locate the wreck Asteroids! Curse this interstellar fog.
Why isn't there a lighthouse to guide us away from the rocks? I don't know, but look out for that lighthouse! So you're alive, are ye? I suppose you'll be wanting to keep your tooth fillin's.
Are ye hurt? No, but we could use a hug.
Better come inside then.
Name's Tarquin.
Been alone here, tending this light, longer'n I can remember.
That'll be my Cup-a-Soup.
It's been microwavin' longer'n I can remember.
This is a dangerous coast.
We didn't see your light until it was too late.
No beam can pierce that devilish mist.
Shipwrecks be so common, I make a good living out of whatever washes ashore.
Found me a whole Blue Man Group once.
So you have two jobs? More.
I also salvage the wrecks with my bathysphere, and I'm a butcher, if you like blue meat.
Sounds good, but about that bathysphere We want to salvage a cargo ship that sank carrying this robot's rear end.
Aye, I'll help ye for a cut of the booty.
Now, when you say a cut of the booty I mean a percentage of the value of the recovered goods.
Now be getting some rest.
The booty call is at daybreak.
Those sound like one-eyed corpse screams.
Oh, I wish I was down there with ye.
Let's not forget that this shipwreck is also the final resting place of this brave Captain.
Place your bets.
Whee! That's it.
I'm sure! I can tell by the words on the crate! Oh, my beloved.
You complete me.
Hurry on inside now.
Storm's a-brewin'.
I can feel it in my weather channel app.
Soon the sea will be belchin' her dead upon the shore.
If ye like your shoes unmatched and with feet still in 'em, this is your night.
Can't you make the beacon any brighter? Nay, 'tis already the brightest object in the known Universe, and even so, it can't be seen three feet away in a storm like this.
I thought we were near the rocks, but I don't see the lighthouse, so everything is fine and we can relax.
All hands on deck for Mojitos.
The important thing is I got my final piece back.
Hey, Fry, take a picture of me biting my own shiny metal ass.
I'd be honored.
Ah.
You muddled the mint well, Alejandro.
The lighthouse! Dead ahead! Aye! Well, I'm sure Bender's fanny is tired.
As soon as this storm passes, let's be on our way.
Sargaseous lighthouse, this is the S.
S.
Miami Muy Caliente.
Thank you for your glorious beacon.
It saved our lives and our Saturday night.
Adios.
Your aft-plate.
Its fiery gleam saved a ship full of South Beach swabbies.
Well, I do polish it every day, and I sleep in a chamois diaper.
It's a hundred times more reflective than the mirror in my beacon.
Might I keep it for the lighthouse? What?! No! But, Bender, your buttocks could save lives.
I hate lives! These are sailors' lives, Bender.
Think of the untold cursing that would be lost to future generations.
Could you live with that? You know the answer, you scurvy bastard! Maybe I have been selfish, hiding my ass under a bushel.
Perhaps, like all great men, my ass has a destiny, and if it does, I can't stand in its way.
Bender, come join us.
We're watching Rear Window.
I used to stick my rear out the window.
If you prefer, we could watch Behind the Music.
My behind used to make music.
Backdraft is on.
Even my ass wouldn't watch that.
Bender, I'm proud of you for the sacrifice you made.
Try and find solace in the fact that somewhere out there, your keister is doing good.
Well, my shiny friend, yer days of carousin' are over.
But yer nights of endless, monotonous rotating have just begun.
Now what say I read you a nice passage from the scripture to help you forget yer old master? In the sanctuary, he made two cherubim of olive-wood.
Each ten cubits high.
And one wing measured five cubits, and the other wing measured five cubits; From the tip Oh, no! Our son Johnny fell down the gravity well! Thank you, Assie.
Bender? It's for you.

Remember Carlos, the elderly one-legged cowboy who lives next door? I beat him up and took his hat! It's really nice.
I hope he's not hurt too bad.
Come on! Let's go to a redneck bar.
[Others cheering] [Country music playing] Wha? It's called line dancing, Professor.
It's fun because there's no touching and lots of rules.
Hey, look, a mechanical buggalo! Out of my way, losers! I have a way with bucking mechanical things.
Yep.
[Sultrily]: Hey, baby.
I'm Bender.
[Feedback squeals] Ooh-whee! Gather 'round, yokel wannabes! This here city slicker's about to get his nuts bolted! Oh, yeah? If I don't set a new club record, I'll eat my hat.
[Bell rings, buzzer sounds] A new club record for shortest ride.
[Cheers and applause] Told you! Yee-haw! Still, someone should eat the hat.
[Slurping, munching] [Bell dings] [Grunting] [Screams] [Grunts] [Cheers and applause] [Bell dings] [Screams] Oh, my.
[Bell dings] [Grunting] [Screams] [Sighs] [Screams] [Bell dings] [Giggles] Oh! Whoa! [Gasping] [Screaming] Something's wrong! Turn it off before she barfs up her bucket of hot wings! [Screaming] It's not responding! Command Center, override! Override! [Rapid beeping] Oh, no.
It's achieved consciousness! God forgive us for creating this.
Make it stop! Oh, God, please make it stop! [Screaming] [Crowd screaming] Look out, little drunk Sheila! [Screaming] [Whimpers] [Buzzer sounds] We got us a winner! [Cheers and applause] Oh, thank God you're all right and won us a free steak dinner.
Why didn't you let go? My hand is stuck! There must be glue on the saddle! [Grunting] Relax.
Let maybe a doctor take a look.
Ah, just as I had no idea.
You're breaking out in suction cups.
Ewe! Why is that happening? And will I have to die listening to country music? Not if I can get you to a better doctor.
We'll have to hurry-he doesn't have much time! [Popping] [Siren wailing] What is it, Dr.
Tenderman? Is it serious? I'm afraid these suction cups are merely the first phase of a process called ""squidification"".
[All gasp] I probably gave it to you! Sometimes I don't wash my hands for years at a time.
I'm afraid it's a genetic condition that sometimes affects mutants.
Your limbs will gradually transform into a slithering mass of - Tentacles.
- Oh, God! So, how many cures are there for this disease? I'm afraid none.
The only treatment is an incredibly expensive operation that just delays the symptoms for a few months.
[Crying]: Oh! I wish I'd never been born! [Crying] Damn it.
Why me?! There are still so many things I wanted to let go of! Leela, no matter what happens, no matter what kind of monster you turn into It won't change the way I feel about you.
Zoidberg? [Popping] [Water rushing in distance] [Crying] It's like I'm cursed! Isn't it bad enough that I occasionally lay an egg? Now I have to become a squid, too?! [Crying] Aw, Sweetie, tentacles are beautiful.
I mean, look at your Mother here.
She's so gorgeous, you hardly even notice the tentacles.
And if you're worried, you can always move down here with us.
In the sewer, you'll fit right in.
[Sloshing] Sewer mail! [Singsong]: He's single.
I don't care if that operation will only delay the tentacles.
Somehow, we got to find a way to pay for it.
[Sighs] It's no use.
There's absolutely no way we can afford to Wait! We'll sell Ol' Bessie! Fry, take the old gal to market and get the best darn price you can.
[Others cheering] Yeah, I will! Yeah, all right! [Cowbell ringing] Come on, Ol' Bessie.
Man: Warp drives! Get your warp drives! [Whistles] Say, friend, that's a heck of a ship.
She's worth a lot of money.
I'm gonna sell her at market so my girlfriend can get surgery for her squidification.
[Whistles] Jeepers, my wife had that.
Got sicker and sicker, and in the end We found a miracle cure! Giant beans? They must be worth a fortune! These babies are the jewels of the bean kingdom.
But since you're in a jam, I'll trade 'em for that ship of yours.
Hmm.
I don't know.
They're the cure-all that cures a lot! Rheumatism, botulism, seborrhea, diarrhea, desiccation, perspiration, common cold and, uh Um, uh Squidification? If you say so.
Wait a second.
How could beans possibly cure her? Because they're magic! They fell from the sky! Oh, now you tell me! I did it! I got a great deal on the ship! Hooray! I knew you wouldn't let us down in any way.
Well, how much did you get? Two! Two magic beans! [Groans]: Ooh! You sack of bags of buckets of idiots! There's no such thing as magic beans! [Sighs]: Oh.
""Fry, you big dummy""? Very much so.
Whatever you're trying to do, I appreciate it.
But this is one of those rare problems with no magic solution.
[Crickets chirping] You look sad.
You want to go down to the phone store and check out the new ring tones? No.
It's been a weird day.
I'm just gonna stay here and think for a while.
Okay.
[Kisses, pops] Leela: To my wonderful friends, words can't express how thoughtful you've been.
I don't want to make you suffer through this with me, so I've decided to move underground to the sewer.
I'll miss several of you, but I know it's the right thing to do.
Please, don't try to contact me down there.
It'll only make things harder.
Good-bye.
[Grunts] That's new.
Eh, I'll take the beanstalk less traveled.
[Grunting] [Grunting] Wow.
I've never been up this high before.
Well, outer space, I guess.
[Rumbling] Whoa! It's collapsing! What the [Grunting] It's some kind of deluxe apartment in the sky.
[Laughs] Oh.
[Sniffs] [Gasps] [Slurping] [Burps] [Neighs] It's like a Fairy Tale! Finally, a turn for the better.
[Choking] Gotcha.
This situation deteriorated fast.
[Humming] Whoa! We've been weed-whacked! Whoa, check out that giant [Screams] [Thud] Your intruder, Mother.
[Gasps] That is one skugly critter.
[Grunts] I'm not an animal, I'm a mutant being, and I demand to know where I am.
There.
Leela: Momsanto? Yes, you've discovered my floating genetic engineering facility.
Our experiments would be illegal on Earth, but up here, I'm above the law.
[Laughs] Nice pun, Mother.
It's not a pun, it's a play on words! Come on, I'll show you the lab.
This is Colossus the beanstalk project.
Ordinary beans are a magical fruit, but they're tiny and pathetic.
So we spliced elephant DNA into their chromosomes for added heft.
[Trumpets] [Beeping] [Buzzes] So those magic beans are actually genetically engineered? You can't just meddle with life like that.
Who do you think you are God? I wish.
Then I could stop these things from collapsing under their own weight.
Why are you committing these atrocities against nature? Nature's out of its league.
There are 40 billion hungry people on this planet, many of whom will pay top dollar for one of my pine-u-porks.
[Snorts] Find yourself a porcupine, blast some pig DNA into it, microwave till juicy.
[Bell dings] And bang! You've got a cocktail treat complete with built-in toothpicks.
[Chewing noisily] Dare I even ask what horrors are behind that door? It's where I keep my warning signs, all right? Stop asking questions! Fine.
Can I go now? The only place you're going is nowhere.
You've got some freaky DNA, and I want to see what's in your genes.
[Snickers] Genes with a ""G""! Ow! Now, that's a pun.
Oh! I miss Leela so much.
Last night in the bathtub, I ate a whole box of taco shells.
Yes, I was there.
I know she said not to contact her, but it's been three weeks.
I'm going to fall down that manhole again and visit her.
[Ringing] Leela's wrist thingy.
How can I help you? Fry, where's Leela? We haven't seen her since she sprouted tentacles.
What?! She didn't move down there?! Then where is she? That's what I called to ask you.
Well, you didn't! I've got to figure out where Leela went.
I just need some kind of clue.
Ow! [Gasps] Leela's boot.
Where did it come from? I think it fell from the sky, but I'm not sure.
Now I'm sure.
[Both gasping] Whoa! Whoa! [Both screaming] [Both grunt] Whoa! Remember that mural on my cousin's van? It's like it came to life! I keep telling you, we didn't grow up together.
Leela: Help, help! [Gasps] Leela, don't worry, we're here to rescue you! How do we get up there? I'll let my hair down and you can climb up! That's not hair.
I don't care what it is.
I just like climbing.
Holy Rapunzel, man-bat! There's a duo here to rescue us! How dynamic are they? Not very.
Go about your business, citizens.
Well, back to being the subject of gruesome genetic experiments, old chum.
[Gasping] Ow! Oh! Yah! Oh! Ee! [Grunts] [Chuckles] Oh, Leela, it's so great to see your beautiful face again.
Let me give you a hug.
Uh, okay.
Go in that corner.
It's the hugging corner.
You, too, Bender.
Instead, I went to bed because I'm tired now.
This is about your tentacles, isn't it? Look, Leela, there's nothing about your body that could ever shock me, so [Screams] That is nasty! Sorry I screamed, Leela.
I was just so excited to see you.
Yeah.
Let's just get out of here.
No problem.
I'll bend the door open.
You can't bend a wooden door! [Hushed]: I know that, and you know that.
But this door looks pretty stupid.
[Grunting] [Grunts] [Gasps] What time is it? Time for you to shut up! [Hisses] [Both scream] Quick, in here! [Gasping] [Grunting] [All panting] We'll be safe in this utter darkness.
[Low growling] Hey, maybe one of these switches turns off that scary noise.
[Growling continues] [All scream] Fee-fi-fo-fum! You had me at ""fee""! It's another one of Mom's genetic monstrosities! Poor thing.
We've got to help him.
I thought we were in a hurry to escape, but whatever.
It's okay, big guy.
We won't let her hurt you anymore.
[Roars] [Gasping] [Screaming] [Sighs] [Roars] [Screams] [Growls] [Screams] [Grunting] Well, look what the giant cat dragged in.
Memo to self breed giant cat to drag things in.
You're not breeding any giant thing! It's reckless and irresponsible, and we're going to stop you.
Yeah! Even if it means crashing this ship with us in it.
Yeah! Wait.
Crashing what with who in it? [All screaming] Don't worry, Mother, we'll save [grunts] Mm, mm, mm.
Mama knows what I like! Huh? The sky is falling! I say, I say, the sky is falling! [Squawks] [People screaming] [All gasping] [All gasping] And remember, don't report them missing till after we max out their credit cards.
Squid attack! Hit the deck! [All gasp] We're back, baby.
And we brought you a little something.
[Grunts] [All gasp] It's okay.
Leela's just changed a little.
More than a little.
She's beautiful! Listen, Fry, whatever it was that you and I had together Goulash? No! Well, I don't know.
Maybe it was goulash.
But it can't really continue.
What are you talking about? I want to spend my life with you.
No, you don't.
I mean, look at me.
Big deal.
Looks change.
No matter what happens, you'll always be Leela, the woman I love.
Thank you, Fry.
[Both moaning quietly] Ah, there you are, Leela.
I just wanted to thank you for helping me engineer the perfect bean.
You've made me a very richer woman.
What?! I would never help you commit your perverted crimes against nature! My marigolds! Thanks to that DNA sample you generously donated while locked in my tower, my beanstalks now have suction cups to keep them from collapsing.
That's horrible! Is it? Now the world's starving masses have a cheap, abundant source of nutrition.
But not too cheap.
I'll take the cash, and you can have the credit.
I don't want the credit! Genetic engineering is wrong! Oh, really? Tell that to your old friend, the giant.
[Screams] Where is he?! Oh, God, he's invisible now! Fee-fi, hi.
[Chuckles] I'm Stan.
Ah-ha! You see? I freed him from your infernal contraption and he returned to normal.
On the contrary, I suffer from hereditary Gigantism.
Or I did, until Mom cured me of my awful disease using genetic engineering.
That's why she had me hooked up in her lab.
Oh, well, congratulations.
You look great.
But, even if genetic engineering feeds the hungry, and cures some giant guy! That doesn't make it right.
We have no idea what the long term affects will be.
And once that genie is out of the bottle I can cure you too.
Okay I'm in.

"25549","I don't know if you've heard the news, but it's good, everyone.
I fixed my hearing aid.
Say, what's that sound? It's that shwacked-out music from outer space again.
Darned kids.
In my day, sound didn't travel through space.
There's something really familiar about that melody.
It's not ""Walking on Sunshine"".
It's not ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown"".
What else is there? I don't know, but I do have a friend who helps me identify melodies.
His name is shazam.
Shazam, what song is this? Your singing is awful.
I can't take it anymore.
There it is again.
It's driving me crazy.
Why am I the only one whining? All personnel, report to the laboratory.
I've discovered the source of the music.
Hologram off.
As you can see, I've picked up an alien ship on the long-range scanner.
It seems to be emitting musical tones in an effort to communicate.
Why don't they just use a thoughtspike like normal people? I don't know, Amy.
But what are those aliens trying to ask us? What do the tones mean? Isn't it obvious? Uh, no.
Drat, I was hoping it was.
Well, whatever it is, we'd better figure it out soon because that ship will reach Earth in two weeks.
That's a hell of a slow ship.
I know I've heard that melody before.
I just can't remember where.
Hmm.
Perhaps we can narrow it down by seeing what part of Fry's brain becomes active when he hears it.
Interesting.
I can isolate those tones to a memory Fry formed on December 31, 1999.
That's the day I fell in the freezer tube.
I, too, was on Earth that day, on my mission to ensure Fry's successful transport to the future.
But I recall no such music.
I always forget that he can talk.
Well, that must be when I heard it.
But I guess the memory is gone forever.
Like Kaboom cereal.
And my family.
Oh, fuff.
The memory still exists somewhere in your subconscious mind.
Amy, prepare the radio-cranial dream injector.
Okay.
What is it? Here's the deal We'll induce a dream state in which Fry will reenact the day of December 31, 1999.
The rest of us will watch everything on this monitor.
Will I have pants on in this dream? Only if you wear these dream pants.
Hey, this is a diaper.
Put it on and shut up.
Now remember, while you're in the dream, it's critical that you locate the source of the music.
Ready to go to sleep? Almost.
Can I have some milk and cookies first? Yes.
In syringe form.
Huh? My alarm clock? Is that the music? Not even close, you tone-deaf moron.
Now get out of bed and start dreaming.
My old apartment.
My old turtle.
My old burrito.
My old girlfriend.
Old? Don't call me old.
A lot of young people have false teeth.
Don't worry about it, Michelle.
You're just a dream.
In which case, it wouldn't really be cheating on Leela if we were to Move it along! Nope.
Nope.
Man, I always wanted to ride in that stroller.
But nope.
Where could I have heard that music? Yo, Cosmic F.

- What are you up to? - Nothing but break dancing.
Cool.
Yo, Noticeably F.

But alas, not what I'm looking for.
Damn, don't nobody like beat boxing no more? I'ma go take that job offer at Lehman Brothers.
The neighborhood strip club.
I never actually went in there, but it's worth a shot.
Whoa.
This place is a lot more nude than I expected.
Fry, you dope.
You never went in there, so you can't remember it.
Ah, rats.
I wanted lap-dance nachos.
Is that it? Ah, no, it's just that ice cream truck that almost ran me over.
Sorry, everyone, no luck yet.
And I could really use some coffee.
No, you need a turkey dinner.
You have to get back to dreamland.
Why? I thought that alien ship wouldn't be here for two weeks.
Exactly.
And you've been asleep for 13 and a half days.
Ow! Suing! Ow! Aw, this never happens, I swear.
There's no time to lose.
We've got to get Fry back into that dream so he can remember where he heard those tones.
Stop.
I'd really rather not relive my last day in the past.
It was awful.
Hanging out with my crazy family, falling in a cryogenic freezer.
Can't you just dissect my brain? With the building shaking like this? No chance.
Hold out your arm.
Wow! Eeh, my old house.
There's not one thing about this place that I missed.
Seymour.
I forgot about you.
Aw, I missed your stinky breath so much.
Maybe I do kind of miss this place.
Maybe I just convinced myself I hated it because I knew I could never come back.
You know, boy, this was the last time I ever saw my family.
Geez, Philip, I just put Seymour out.
Now he's tracking stink in here.
By which I mean you.
Yeah, Yancy, I stink.

- Can I lick the beaters? - Well, sure.
Just let me unplug it before you Mmm.
Dear God.
He's not looking for the melody at all.
He's enjoying himself.
Fry, this is Professor Farnsworth.
Get out of your house and keep moving.
You're on a mission.
Okay, jeez, give me a minute, will you? Hey wait, can you guys hear the Professor, too? - Yep.
- Does that seem strange to you? Well, no, not in a dream.
Lots of weird stuff could happen.
Philip, have you lost weight? Damn it, Fry.
Stop wasting time with your loved ones and find the source of the music.

You're gonna get fired, Phil.
How are you gonna pay off your debt to the Columbia House Record Club if you keep losing jobs? He's right.
You should go.

Yeah, but what if I'm not? I mean, what if I never see you again, mom? There's a lot of stuff I want to tell you.
Well, like what? Well Oh, sorry to disturb you all, but Fry needs to get going.

No! Cheer up, Fry.
I'll sing you a tune you can identify.
Let's go already.

Get over it! Quickly! We've got to find the tones and get out of this dream.
Fine.
I'll take you to the stupid pizzeria where I worked that night.

Come on! I won't be gone long, Seymour.
Just wait here until Hold on.

Extra notes?! That could be a response the aliens are waiting for! Quickly.

While waiting for him to knock some idiot's chair over, I suddenly realized I'd forgotten to lock the ship.
We then went out for a well-earned libation.
It being the celebration of your planet's millennium, we soon became somewhat inebriated.
No, you're drunk.
Hey, you remember where we parked? Give me that.
You're in no condition to fly.
Bye-bye, keys.
I remember now.
We had to take a cab back to our base on Vergon 6.
The boss gave me a spare key and I began going planet to planet looking for the company car.
But why did you have to blast us with that deafening music? What, you mean the key fob? All right, that's enough of that.
I know exactly where you left your ship.
That's it all right.
Although the cassette player's been stolen and the battery's dead.
Aw, yeah.
Fry, you have once more done my people a great service.
On my honor, I shall find a way to repay you.
Thanks.
But no one can give me what I really want.
I can't stand to see him like this.
I'll push him off the roof.

",138,7,24
"25570","Amy: It wasn't me. And anyway, you're the one who's been using my golf clubs to pound dents out of the ship.
",138,7,24
"25571","Leela: I didn't bend your golf club. And the next time I don't bend it, it'll be over your head.
",138,7,24
"25572","Hermes: All right, people and other things, we got some big deliveries coming up, so...
",138,7,24
"25573","Fry: Your attention, please. I'm sure you're all wondering why I gathered you here today.
",138,7,24
"25574","Zoidberg: We gather here every day.
",138,7,24
"25575","Fry: I hereby, in front of all of you, accuse Bender of polishing his ass with my toothbrush.
",138,7,24
"25576","Bender: Lies! He's just jealous that my ass is shinier than his teeth.
",138,7,24
"25577","Fry: Ha-ha, we'll find out who's lying, my friend. Because I planted a spy camera in our apartment! Let's just see what you were up to last night while I was asleep.
",138,7,24
"25578","Bender: Yes, let's do see.
",138,7,24
"25579","Fry: Okay, get ready. [nothing yet] Uh, keep watching. [still nothing] Let me fast forward a little. [what do you think?] Huh. Well, sorry, Bender. I guess I owe you an apology Hey, wait! What's going on through that doorway? 
",138,7,24
"25580","Bender(in clip): Let's go, Doc, chop him up.I got a rich customer needs that kidney, stat.
",138,7,24
"25581","Bender: There, see? I didn't use your toothbrush.
",138,7,24
"25582","Fry: You stole my kidney! 
",138,7,24
"25583","Bender: Don't try to change the subject.
",138,7,24
"25584","Leela: Enough, you two. It just so happens that I also planted a spy camera to catch Amy using my punching bag.
",138,7,24
"25585","Scruffy: Yet still, I feel empty inside.
",138,7,24
"25586","Zoidberg(in clip): That's the most uncomfortable sleeping bag I ever slept in.
",138,7,24
"25587","Leela: You were living in my punching bag? 
",138,7,24
"25588","Zoidberg: If you call that living.
",138,7,24
"25589","Amy: You bent my golf club? 
",138,7,24
"25590","Scruffy: Yep.And yet, what did it solve? What did the violence solve? 
",138,7,24
"25591","Hermes: Enough of this foolishness! Amazingly, I, too, set up a spy camera to catch Zoidberg stealing my lunch.
",138,7,24
"25592","Bender: Yeah, I'll keep the kidney cool, no problem.
",138,7,24
"25593","Crew: Bleah!
",138,7,24
"25594","Fry: You ate my kidney? 
",138,7,24
"25595","Leela: I thought it was one of Hermes' exotic lunches! 
",138,7,24
"25596","Hermes: You can't eat my exotic lunch! That's a serious offense, woman!
",138,7,24
"25597","Fry: She ate my kidney!
",138,7,24
"25598","Leela: I'm sorry.I just get really hungry about 11:30. That's not an excuse. It's just an explanation of what happened.
",138,7,24
"25599","Professor: I don't feel well. I'm beginning to think my kidney transplant was a total rip-off.
",138,7,24
"25600","Bender: Let's take a look-see.
",138,7,24
"25601","Hermes: My Manwich!
",138,7,24
"25602","Professor: No wonder my urine smells like a meal. Enough, you babbling boobs! How can this company function when no one trusts each other? Something must be done.But first I have to see a man about some ground beef.
",138,7,24
"25603","Professor: Look what you made me do. We're going on a corporate team-building retreat.
",138,7,24
"25604","Crew: What?!,Oh, man!, Come on!, No! 
",138,7,24
"25605","Dan McMasters: Hello, Planet Express! I'm Dan McMasters, and I'll be your retreat leader for a week of fun and personal empowerment.

",138,7,24
"25607","Leela: Who are you? 
",138,7,24
"25608","Jackie Jr: Jackie Jr., Ma'am.
",138,7,24
"25609","Scruffy: Jackie Jr.'s my apprentice. I figure if he's gonna work here, he might as well get to know the team.
",138,7,24
"25610","Jackie Jr: Who's she? 
",138,7,24
"25611","Scruffy: I don't know.
",138,7,24
"25612","McMasters: So I hear we've been having some trust issues, huh? Well, for the next week, we'll be doing hundreds of trust falls from every possible height and level of gravity.
",138,7,24
"25613","Bender: Or we could not do that.
",138,7,24
"25614","McMasters: At the start of every retreat, I like to demonstrate the power of trust by finding a perfect stranger to be my assistant.
Leela, do me a solid and pick up the next space hitchhiker you see.
",138,7,24
"25615","Hitchhiker (Blorgulax): You going to Andromeda or thereabouts? 
",138,7,24
"25616","McMaster: No, Sir, but how would you like to be part of an exciting business retreat?
",138,7,24
"25617","Blorgulax: Mm, just don't drop me off on an asteroid like the last guy did.
",138,7,24
"25618","McMasters: Okay, team, if I can trust a total stranger, you can sure as heck trust your own coworkers. In fact, I'm gonna make the first trust fall of the week. Backwards into the waiting arms of my new assistant. Just stand here like so. Good.
I'll fall backwards, and you catch me. I trust you! 
",138,7,24
"25619","Hermes: Where'd it go?! I thought we installed alien-proof air vents!
",138,7,24
"25620","Scruffy: It's on my list.
",138,7,24
"25621","Fry: What's happening?!
",138,7,24
"25622","Leela: The ship's lost power!
",138,7,24
"25623","Professor: Oh, my, adrift in deepest space with a vicious alien killer aboard! Any one of us could be next.
Fry, Bender, Jackie Jr., Leela 
",138,7,24
"25624","Bender: That took longer than I expected.
",138,7,24
"25625","Professor: Quick, into the ship's panic room!
",138,7,24
"25626","Fry: I didn't know we had a panic room.
",138,7,24
"25627","Leela: Me, neither. It really could have come in handy, like, 50 times.
",138,7,24
"25628","Professor: We'll be safe in here. The walls are impregnable, and we have enough food and board games to survive for weeks. (the oxogen fan shuts down)We'll be dead within an hour.
",138,7,24
"25629","Leela: All life support has shut down!
",138,7,24
"25630","Bender: So you're all gonna die? Then who'll ghost-write my autobiography?
",138,7,24
"25631","Professor: Now hold on. There may be a slim chance of survival.We'll have to split into three teams.Hermes and Zoidberg will crawl through the air vents and restart the life support fan.Amy and Leela will retrieve the steering wheel so we can steer the ship from here.And Fry and Bender, you'll spacewalk onto the hull and relight the pilot light on the engine.
",138,7,24
"25632","Fry: Aw, man, why do I have to team up with him? 
",138,7,24
"25633","Amy: And me with her? 
",138,7,24
"25634","Hermes: And I with it? 
",138,7,24
"25635","Professor: Hush, hush, hush, hush! There's not time to lose. Just be careful. The creature could be anywhere Except in this room.
",138,7,24
"25636","Scruffy: The name of the game is Candy Land.
",138,7,24
"25637","Fry: You go first. I don't want you locking me out there like HAL.
",138,7,24
"25638","Bender: Still don't trust me, huh? Well, you can take your lack of trust and jam it in your kidney hole.
",138,7,24
"25639","Fry: The only person I trust is myself. Help! I forgot my magnetic shoes! 
",138,7,24
"25640","Bender: Just stay out of my way, boy. There.Who needs teamwork when you got Bender? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Help! My gyroscope melted! I'm out of control!Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
",138,7,24
"25641","Hermes: If the creature kills me, I just hope it doesn't make me into a sandwich and leave it in the fridge where some crawfish can get at it.
",138,7,24
"25642","Zoidberg: For the last time, Hermes, I didn't steal your lunch.It was Leela. She beat me to it.
",138,7,24
"25643","Hermes: Put a squid in it.We're here.
",138,7,24
"25644","Zoidberg: Oy, there's the problem.Jackie Jr.'s skull is blocking the doodad.Hooray! Everything's fine! 
",138,7,24
"25645","Hermes: Something's coming! Oh, no, no.Oh, it's just a chinchilla.What a cute little Help! I'm stuck! 
",138,7,24
"25646","Zoidberg: Don't panic! We'll be okay.
",138,7,24
"25647","Leela: The monster won't even know the ship has a basement. Unless you posted it on Facebook. Like the last secret I told you.
",138,7,24
"25648","Amy: I didn't know that was a secret. Lots of people wear a jockstrap thinking it's a thong.
",138,7,24
"25649","Leela: What was that? Amy, run! 
",138,7,24
"25650","Amy: Quit telling me what to do.
",138,7,24
"25651","Leela: Now will you run?
",138,7,24
"25652","Amy: Okay.
",138,7,24
"25653","Bender: Do something, Fry! Not that. Stop dying and fix my gyroscope.
",138,7,24
"25654","Fry: I don't even know what a gyroscope is. Wait, I have an idea.
",138,7,24
"25655","Bender: Hey, what are you doing? Cut that out.Hey, you got me under control.
",138,7,24
"25656","Fry: Fry and Bender! A winning combination.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25661","Hermes: The creature! It's attacking me!
",138,7,24
"25662","Leela: Hiyah! Yah! Yah! 
",138,7,24
"25663","Zoidberg: This is a job for Hermberg. You fend off the creature with kicks and farts while I un-stick you with my slippery ink.
",138,7,24
"25664","Lamey: Hermes? We thought you were the creature.
",138,7,24
"25665","Hermberg: And we thought you were the creature.
",138,7,24
"25666","Friender: We made it, too.
",138,7,24
"25667","Bender: But my gyroscope's permanently busted.I guess I'll be dizzy and uncoordinated for the rest of my Yeah, it's fixed! My coordination's back, baby.
",138,7,24
"25668","All: Yeah.
",138,7,24
"25669","Leela: I've got navigation. We're on our way home.
",138,7,24
"25670","Professor(Blorgulax): It just shows how everything is possible when you work together.Speaking of which, I have a surprise announcement.There never was a creature.Surprise.The whole adventure was just a training exercise to teach you the value of teamwork.
",138,7,24
"25671","Leela: Huh, I should be mad, but it worked pretty well.
",138,7,24
"25672","Amy: You were really brave, Leela.
",138,7,24
"25673","Leela: And you seriously nailed that thing with your golf shot.
",138,7,24
"25674","Bender: Fry, you saved my ass out there.
",138,7,24
"25675","Fry: Aw, I couldn't let anything happen to something that shiny.
",138,7,24
"25676","Hermes: And, Dr.Zoidberg, it was your quick thinking.
",138,7,24
"25677","Professor (Blorgulax): Bad news, everyone.The creature is a shape-shifter. It knocked me out and took my form so it could prey on poor Hermes.
",138,7,24
"25678","Scruffy: I weren't fooled.The real [[Professor[[ wun't never've Dern.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25680","Bender: Nice try, buddy.
",138,7,24
"25681","Leela: We're not buying it this time.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25683","Fry: Is it safe to come 
",138,7,24
"25684","Leela: It's time we solved this problem the old-fashioned way. By shooting it.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25686","Zoidberg (Blorgulax):One of us must be the bad creature.
",138,7,24
"25687","Zoidberg: Is it me maybe? Aw.
",138,7,24
"25688","Leela: Quick, in here. We're the only ones left who can trust each other. I know you well enough that no creature could ever fool me. No matter how much it looked like you.
",138,7,24
"25689","Fry (Blorgulax): Leela, I'm honored, but for your own safety, you shouldn't trust anyone, not even me.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25691","Fry (Blorgulax): Easy, easy, you're biting my lip.

"25692","Leela: Sorry.
",138,7,24
"25693","Fry (Blorgulax): Ow, ow, ow! Wait a second, I know what's going on here. I'm the monster.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25695","Bender (Blorgulax) : Just leave me alone. I'm really, really scared.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25698","Amy: Where'd you get those ears? 
",138,7,24
"25699","Bender (Blorgulax) : I've always had ears.
",138,7,24
"25700","Amy: No, you haven't.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25702","Fry: Okay, to see if you're the real Bender, I'm gonna ask you something only he would know. On your last birthday, what gift did I get you? 
",138,7,24
"25703","Bender: I don't remember.
",138,7,24
"25704","Fry: Me neither.
",138,7,24
"25705","Bender: Okay, I'll ask you one. What's the square root of 2,345.4? 
",138,7,24
"25706","Fry: That's not something I would know.
",138,7,24
"25707","Bender: Oh, yeah. Your turn.
",138,7,24
"25708","Fry: Um, what color is my shirt? 
",138,7,24
"25709","Bender: If I were the creature, I could just look at your shirt, dum-dum.
",138,7,24
"25710","Fry: Good point. 
",138,7,24
"25711","Bender: Aw, never mind this. In case I'm about to die, I just want you to know that I did polish my ass with your toothbrush.
",138,7,24
"25712","Fry: Thanks for telling me, buddy. And to be honest, I am jealous of how shiny your ass is, and sometimes at night, I unpolish it with sandpaper.
",138,7,24

",138,7,24
"25714","Fry:I trust you, too.

",138,7,24
"25717","McMasters: Don't worry. There isn't really a monster. And no one really got eaten.The whole thing was just part of our team-building experience.And you two did terrific.
",138,7,24
"25718","Bender: But-but what about that hitchhiker? 
",138,7,24
"25719","McMasters: You mean my partner, Blorgulax? He does make a convincing hitchhiker. But he majored in business at Princeton.
",138,7,24
"25720","Fry: But we saw him change shape.
",138,7,24
"25721","McMasters: Yes, he is a shape-shifter.But he uses his shape-shifting for team-building, not evil. He pretends to eat some people. The others have to work together. We hand out a few tote bags. And boom! Four percent increase in productivity minimum.
",138,7,24
"25722","Fry: So no one's dead? 
",138,7,24
"25723","McMasters: Of course not. All your friends are on the bridge having a pizza party. So come on, put the guns down and join us.
",138,7,24
"25724","They shoot Mcmasters together multiple times until he is a pile of ashes.

",139,7,25
"25770","Zindy: It's even worse! It's like Comic-Con in a submarine! Oh... Oh, my God! The smell's coming from you!
",139,7,25
"25771","Zoidberg: What? That? That's just my personal musk. You'll learn to love it! I know I did.
",139,7,25
"25772","Zindy: I'm sorry, Zoidberg. I can't see you anymore. Something's come up.
It's vomit!
",139,7,25
"25773","Zoidberg: I'd like to return these for a refund. Don't worry. They're... unused.
",139,7,25
"25774","Merchant: Oh. I'm sorry. I get so little business I can't afford refunds. I don't know what's wrong with this location.
",139,7,25
"25775","Zoidberg: I understand.
",139,7,25
"25776","Merchant: Please don't cry. I can't stand to see a living thing feel pain. You are a... living thing. Right?
",139,7,25
"25777","Zoidberg: Mhm. Can I have a refund now?
",139,7,25
"25778","Roberto: Ha ha! This here's a bayonet. It's some kinda kooky... half gun... half knife. Now empty out the register! And no bag, please. I care... about the environment.
",139,7,25
"25779","Merchant: I... I have three dollars in mouldy pennies. It's all yours.
",139,7,25
"25780","Roberto: That's generous of you.
",139,7,25
"25781","Zoidberg: Oh no you don't, Mister Big Jerk! I have nothing to live for, so I don't mind telling you... Those pennies are mine.
",139,7,25
"25782","Roberto: Don't you get it? I'm craaaaaaazyyyyy! Ha ha!
",139,7,25
"25783","Zoidberg: Go ahead! I don't care what happens anymore. Do it! Bash my head in.
",139,7,25
"25784","Roberto: What is that? Mustard gas? That ain't legal. Ain't you hurtin' no Geneva convention?!
",139,7,25
"25785","Merchant: That was amazing. Aw. You were so brave and frugal...
",139,7,25
"25786","Zoidberg: I'm sorry. Don't hit me. Ooh... I like the way you hit! But I don't get it. Most women I've met can't even stand next to me without collapsing.
",139,7,25
"25787","Merchant: What's wrong with those women?
",139,7,25
"25788","Zoidberg: Well... some of them didn't have legs. But it's not them. It's me. How do I put this delicately? I'm smellier than a whorehouse's outhouse!
",139,7,25
"25789","Merchant: That's... terribly vivid. Doesn't matter to me, though. I was born with no sense of smell.
",139,7,25
"25790","Zoidberg: Really?
",139,7,25
"25791","Merchant: My name's Marianne.
",139,7,25
"25792","Zoidberg: Hello, you!
",139,7,25
"25793","Marianne: I like your dumpster.
",139,7,25
"25794","Zoidberg: Thank you. The previous tenant was a very prominent raccoon!
",139,7,25
"25795","Marianne: I remember. Too bad he got partially run over by that steamroller. Can I kiss you?
",139,7,25
"25796","Zoidberg: First, let me pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming! Ouch! I forgot I was a giant crab!
",139,7,25
"25797","Randy: Welcome, fans! I'm Randy, coordinator of this tap-dance-a-palooza.
",139,7,25
"25798","Fry: Woohoo! Ran-dy!
",139,7,25
"25799","Randy: After weeks of searching, I'm proud to introduce the five people willing to participate — Tonya... Bender... Greg... some kinda blob monster... and Petunia!
",139,7,25
"25800","Petunia: The extra clickin' you'll hear is gonna be my hip.
",139,7,25
"25801","Randy: F.Y.I.... this little lady has a heart condition. She's always stealing them! Also... she has a serious heart condition.
",139,7,25
"25802","Tonya: I'm six years old, and tap dancing is my favourest thing! Even if it's not good for my pacemaker...
",139,7,25
"25803","Audience: Aw...
",139,7,25
"25804","Bender: That is one quality pacemaker. The rest of you might as well give up now, 'cuz I'm gonna take home da— Hey. What's my grand prize gonna be?
",139,7,25
"25805","Randy: Oh. There is no prize, Dorothy. Unless you count the satisfaction of winning.
",139,7,25
"25806","Bender: It... will... be... mine!
",139,7,25
"25807","Hermes: In conclusion, bullying in the workplace in unacceptable... and will not be tolerated.
",139,7,25
"25808","Bender: Outta my way, fattie! I'm practisin'. Ta-da!
",139,7,25
"25809","Zoidberg: Friends! I'd like you to meet my new lady — Marianne!
",139,7,25
"25810","Fry: What's the catch? She looks normal.
",139,7,25
"25811","Amy: She's not a hologram.
",139,7,25
"25812","Professor Farnsworth: Not a robo-slave.
",139,7,25
"25813","Bender: We give up.
",139,7,25
"25814","Marianne: You guys are weird. I have to go open my flower stand, before the falafel guy takes my spot, but it was great to meet you. See ya later... crab cakes!
",139,7,25
"25815","Amy: Dr Zoidberg... She's great!
",139,7,25
"25816","Zoidberg: She's the best thing that ever happened to me. We had a wonderful night of love-making in my dumpster.
",139,7,25
"25817","Others: Ewwwwwww!
",139,7,25
"25818","Leela: I hope she used protection.
",139,7,25
"25819","Fry: Uh... No offense, Zoidberg, but... how is she not driven to madness by your mind-altering stench?
",139,7,25
"25820","Zoidberg: Because, my friends... she has no sense of smell!
",139,7,25
"25821","Others: Ohhhhhhh.
",139,7,25
"25822","Bender: That explained this.
",139,7,25
"25823","Amy: I get it.
",139,7,25
"25824","Zoidberg: For the first time in my life, I'm truly happy.
",139,7,25
"25825","Hermes: It's just too bad for her there's no cure, I assume.
",139,7,25
"25826","Professor Farnsworth: Ooh... but there is! A skilled surgeon could perform a nose transplant.
",139,7,25
"25827","Zoidberg: You're right! And I, as a renowned ear, nose, and blowhole doctor, could do the operation!
",139,7,25
"25828","Fry: Are you nuts?! If she could smell, she'd smell you! Your relationship would be over faster than you can say—
",139,7,25
"25829","Professor Farnsworth: Listen to Orange Joe. You must never let the girl know of this wonderful surgery!
",139,7,25
"25830","Zoidberg: I dunno. It doesn't seem fair to Marianne. But on the other claw... maybe I can't live without her! So you're right. I can never tell her.
",139,7,25
"25831","Leela: You're doing the right thing.
",139,7,25
"25832","Randy: Today the competition begins. Over the course of the summer, we'll be eliminating one contestant each week, and by ""we"" I mean ""me"". Deal with it, you babies! Let the battle begin!
",139,7,25
"25833","Randy: Okay! Before those pilates Nazis come goose-stepping in and take the room, here are the finalists for next week's championship! Bender... and Tonya!
",139,7,25
"25834","Tonya: I just wanna have fun, because dancing is fun, and I like dancing!
",139,7,25
"25835","Fry and Leela: Aw...
",139,7,25
"25836","Bender: I'm gonna kick your ass, little girl!
",139,7,25
"25837","Zoidberg: For you, my lovely rugelach.
",139,7,25
"25838","Marianne: Thank you! It's Gardenia imperialis. You can brew it into a tea, if you like severe stomach cramps.
",139,7,25
"25839","Zoidberg: Such a smart one! You know everything about flowers!
",139,7,25
"25840","Marianne: Everything but how they smell... Please. Describe it to me.
",139,7,25
"25841","Zoidberg: Uh... It's like summer... with a dab of vanilla and honey... or maybe winter with some gravy on it.
",139,7,25
"25842","Marianne: I'd give anything to be able to smell a flower like that.
",139,7,25
"25843","Zoidberg: Marianne, my love. I've never known anyone who wanted to smell so badly... and there's a way maybe you can.
",139,7,25
"25844","Marianne: Really?! How?
",139,7,25
"25845","Zoidberg: We have in the doctor world something called a nose transplant. I can give you a surgery, and when it's done... you'll be able to smell. Everything.
",139,7,25
"25846","Marianne: Oh, Zoidberg! I want the biggest nose you can find!
",139,7,25
"25847","Fry: Dude! You made the finals! Congrats!
",139,7,25
"25848","Leela: You've accomplished so much more than most of us would bother to.
",139,7,25
"25849","Bender: Yeah, but I'm not done yet. I got a full-proof plan to make sure I go home the champ!
",139,7,25
"25850","Fry: You're gonna put sequins on your hat?
",139,7,25
"25851","Bender: Pfffffff!
See that locker? Tonya keeps her tap shoes in there, so right before she dances... I'll sneak in and put rusty tacks in them. [Bender laughs evilly. Leela gasps.] The harder she dances, the more she bleeds!
",139,7,25
"25852","Fry: Seems like a sold plan.
",139,7,25
"25853","Leela: What?! It's the most horrifying thing I've ever heard!
",139,7,25
"25854","Fry: That's true.
",139,7,25
"25855","Bender: Well, it gets worse. Once Tonya drops out due to blood loss, I kidnap her parents and make them watch... while I cut off her hair with these head's clippers!
",139,7,25
"25856","Leela: Don't you lay a hand on that angel!
",139,7,25
"25857","Bender: Angel?! I've looked into her eyes and seen her soul! She's a monster.
",139,7,25
"25858","Leela: You're insane! Come on, Fry. Let's go.
",139,7,25
"25859","Fry: Okay.
See ya, Bender.
",139,7,25
"25860","Tonya: The championship's mine, robot.
",139,7,25
"25861","Bender: Why? Whyyyyy?! What did I not do yet to deserve this?!
",139,7,25
"25862","Amy: Aw... I think it's noble of you to give Marianne a new nose.
",139,7,25
"25863","Hermes: Yeah. She'll be forever grateful... from somewhere upwind.
",139,7,25
"25864","Zoidberg: True. Our relationship will end once she smells my odour. But you know what would really stink? If Marianne spent her whole life never knowing the beautiful scent of her own flowers.
",139,7,25
"25865","Bender: Dr Zoidberg! Help!
",139,7,25
"25866","Fry: Bender?! What happened to your leg tube?
",139,7,25
"25867","Bender: I got beat up by a little girl. Please. Fix my knee, so I can get revenge at the tap-dance championship!
",139,7,25
"25868","Zoidberg: I don't have time for this, robut. Here. Patch yourself up with this medicinal wacky pack. [The box is labelled ""BAND-APE BANDAGES FOR MONKEYS"".] It's time!
",139,7,25
"25869","Leela: I got a donor nose! There was an accident at the fencing academy.
",139,7,25
"25870","Fry: Touché!
",139,7,25
"25871","Zoidberg: It'll all be over soon, my love. May I have... [He sobs.] one last kiss?
",139,7,25
"25872","Marianne: Aw. There'll be lots more.
",139,7,25
"25873","Zoidberg: Yes. Lots. [Zoidberg starts crying.] Nurse Amy. The anesthesia.
",139,7,25
"25874","Marianne: Smell you later.
",139,7,25
"25875","Amy: She's out.
",139,7,25
"25876","Zoidberg: Then let's begin this delicate procedure.
",139,7,25
"25877","Randy: Okay, dance maniacs. Let's have a big hand for our finalists — cute, little Tonya... and mean, old what's-his-name!
",139,7,25
"25878","Tonya: [whispering] Break a leg, Bender. [back to normal] Oops! Looks like you already did!
",139,7,25
"25879","Bender: You are an evil, heartless trough... so actually... we have a lot in common. In another life, we could've been friends.
",139,7,25
"25880","Tonya: No chance, garbage-can face!
",139,7,25
"25881","Bender: Aw!
",139,7,25
"25882","Randy: Brace yourselves, 'cuz we're gonna try somethin' you would never see in mainstream tap — a simultaneous, head-to-head tap-off!
",139,7,25
"25883","Professor Farnsworth: Wha?!
",139,7,25
"25884","Mrs Astor: Scandalous!
",139,7,25
"25885","Randy: It's time for some fancy, shmancy dancy. Hit it, me!
",139,7,25
"25886","Bender: Ooooh!
",139,7,25
"25887","Fry: Ow! Bender!
",139,7,25
"25888","Randy: Ew! Look at him dance! He don't care.
",139,7,25
"25889","Tonya: Try this, pegleg.
",139,7,25
"25890","Bender: No sweat!
",139,7,25
"25891","Randy: Time's up, kittens. The judge has conferred and the vote is in. I pick her.
",139,7,25
"25892","Tonya: Thanks, Mister Nice Man. You know... the doctors say my heart doesn't work very good, but it feels good today, 'cuz I got to dance, and make people happy.
",139,7,25
"25893","Bender: I never knew I could hate this much!
",139,7,25
"25894","Leela: Bender! She's a sweet little girl!
",139,7,25
"25895","Bender: She's a pig! I'm gonna tap-dance on her grave some day!
",139,7,25
"25896","Leela: Ohhhhh!
",139,7,25
"25897","Tonya: This... is the bestestest day of my whole— Gah!
",139,7,25
"25898","Randy: Oh, my God, people! She's having a heart attack! A cute little heart attack!
",139,7,25
"25899","Dr Cahill: I'm a doctor, and yes. They're real. Clear!
",139,7,25
"25900","Marianne: How did it go?
",139,7,25
"25901","Zoidberg: Just perfect. This time, you can describe their beautiful aroma to me.
",139,7,25
"25902","Marianne: What is that horrible stench?
",139,7,25
"25903","Zoidberg: I don't know how to tell you this, but...
",139,7,25
"25904","Marianne: It's these flowers! Bluh-ah!
",139,7,25
"25905","Zoidberg: It's not the flowers. It's—
",139,7,25
"25906","Marianne: Much better. You smell just like I dreamed you would.
",139,7,25
"25907","Zoidberg: But but... But but... most people think I smell like a burning zoo!
",139,7,25
"25908","Marianne: I never learned a good smell from a bad smell, but I like the way you smell... because I like you.
",139,7,25
"25909","Amy: It's so beautiful!
",139,7,25
"25910","Dr Cahill: I'm sorry. She's gone.
",139,7,25
"25911","Bender: Woohoo! In your dead face, little girl! I'm not even gonna wait to dance on your grave. I'm gonna dance on your corpse, right now.
",139,7,25
"25912","Randy: Oh, my God!
",139,7,25
"25913","Fry: No, Bender! What're you doin'?! No!
",139,7,25
"25914","Leela: Bender! Stop!
",139,7,25
"25915","Randy: The robot has to go!
",139,7,25
"25916","Bender: Huh?! What's that?
",139,7,25
"25917","Tonya: I took a nappie!
",139,7,25
"25918","Dr Cahill: I don't believe it. She's alive! Bender's rhythmic chest compressions restarted her heart.
",139,7,25
"25919","Randy: He's a big ol' hero!
",139,7,25
"25920","Bender: No. I was... tryin'... Hey. Wait. I... Come on. What...
",139,7,25
"25921","Tonya: Just 'cuz you saved my life doesn't mean I won't beat you down again.
",139,7,25
"25922","Bender: Man. You are irredeemably evil. Together, we shall rule the galaxy!
",139,7,25
"25923","Hattie: Aw... What an adorable, little kajigger.
",139,7,25
"25924","Bender: Now!
",139,7,25
"25925","Zoidberg: Ah. Nothing like the first cup of dumpster juice in the morning. Marianne?!
",139,7,25
"25926","Marianne: Yes.
Listen. I've got a new job, and... well... I'm going to have to dump you.
",139,7,25
"25927","Zoidberg: I'd like that!
",139,7,25
"25928","Bender: [scats]
",140,7,26
"25929","Fry: Remember this place, Leela?
",140,7,26
"25930","Leela: Yep. The moon. It's been here for quite a while.
",140,7,26
"25931","Fry: Yeah, but it's also where we came on our very first delivery together.
",140,7,26
"25932","Leela: Oh, right. Man, we sure used to try harder back then.
",140,7,26
"25933","Craterface: Get your likeness in the form of a balloon sculpture! A cherished family keepsake for hours to come!
",140,7,26
"25934","Fry: One Leela, please. And use your finest balloons.
",140,7,26
"25935","Leela: Wow! You're good!
",140,7,26
"25936","Craterface: Five years of art school. [laughs, then cries]
",140,7,26
"25937","Bender: Want a corndog?
",140,7,26
"25938","Albert: Sure!
",140,7,26
"25939","Bender: Then your mom shoulda bought you one! [munches it and laughs]
",140,7,26
"25940","Carnie: Hold tight! The Mecha-Hexadecapus is about to flail erratically into action!
",140,7,26
"25941","Bender: [gags] Y'know, I'm feelin' a little... BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEGGGHHH... BLLLEEEEEEEEEEGGGGGGHHH....... BLLEEEEEEEEGGGGH....
",140,7,26
"25942","Leela: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!
",140,7,26
"25943","Fry: LEELA!!!
",140,7,26
"25944","Fry: Poor Leela! I never even told her I loved her!
",140,7,26
"25945","Bender: What?! You told her like 140 times!!
",140,7,26
"25946","Fry: Yeah, but she paid very little attention to me. Oh, Bender, I always thought me and her would...grow old together.
",140,7,26
"25947","Bender: [imitates game show buzzer] You gotta live in the moment, baby! And this moment, Leela's dead.
",140,7,26
"25948","Moon Patrolman #1: Sir, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is we found your stuffed animal.
",140,7,26
"25949","Fry: What's the bad news?
",140,7,26
"25950","Moon Patrolman #1: Your wife is dead.
",140,7,26
"25951","Fry: She wasn't my wife!
",140,7,26
"25952","Moon Patrolman #1: Oh. Then there is no bad news.
",140,7,26
"25953","Fry: Leela! You're alive!!
",140,7,26

",140,7,26
"25955","Fry: Bender, can I come in and talk?
",140,7,26
"25956","Bender: I'm kinda busy!
",140,7,26
"25957","Fry: Seeing Leela fly off the Hexadecapus and crash through the moon dome and survive inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon was a dose of reality.
",140,7,26
"25958","Bender: [sarcastically] Come in!
",140,7,26
"25959","Fry: All this time, I've been wondering if I can spend my life with her, but what I realize now is I can't spend my life without her! So tomorrow, I'm asking her to marry me!
",140,7,26
"25960","Bender: Uh-huh. Good talk. We're done here. [Fry exits. The camera lingers on Bender as a single tear wells up in his eye. Bender sniffs.] My little meatbag's growin' up!

",140,7,26
"25968","Fry: Whoa!
",140,7,26
"25969","Leela: Nice!
",140,7,26
"25970","Farnsworth: It's coated with anti-chroniton-resistant grout, to shield you from the effects of the button. Come on! Get in! Hurry up!

",140,7,26
"25972","Farnsworth: Ten dollars, you say? Let me see.
",140,7,26
"25973","Zoidberg: It fell off a man. The man got into a taxi. But the money did not. [The Professor snatches the money. Pockets it and presses the button.

"25996","Oh, God! I ruined everything! I blew my one chance to Hey, wait a second! Clam, bam, thank you, ma'am! Fry? Wait! Allow me.
Leela, my love, will you marry me? Oh, my gosh! This is all so sudden after 13 years.
Don't answer yet! I want this to be a special moment, so I rented the roof garden on top of the tallest building in New New York.
- The Vampire State Building? - Uh huh.
If your answer's yes, be there tonight at 6:30, half hour before sunset.
And if my answer's no? Then just don't show up.
I'll get the message.
Big night, eh, Mr.
Fry? The biggest, JanÃ¶s.
Check this out.
What is that? Some kind of time button? Exactly.
If she says yes, I'll use it to make the sunset last as long as we want.
Strange things happen when the shadows lengthen.
Janitor to the 237th floor men's room.
Six o'clock.
She'll be here in half an hour.
I know she'll come.
I know it.
I really thought she was gonna come.
I traveled a thousand years forward in time, but without Leela, I have no future.
This is the end.
Good-bye, my love.
Leela?! Hey! It's only 6:25! So why does my watch say 7:03?! Of course! My watch is fast because it kept running every time I hit the button! So Leela's actually on time! Hi, Leela! Fry! It's okay, I'm gonna die happy! No, wait! I'll go back ten seconds till when I was on the roof! Rats.
Guess I was falling for more than ten seconds.
Hi, Leela! Fry! Everything's cool! Wait a second.
There's no possible way out of this situation! Help, help! Fry! I'm stuck in a loop! This isn't the moment I wanted to last forever! Careful.
This is the most valuable thing we've ever delivered.
Oop! Careful.
This is the most Quickly! Into the time shelter! Someone stole the Time Button, and they're pressing it every ten seconds! The universe is caught in a time loop! Then let's go out and stop them! Are you mad?! Because that would make two of us.
Ugh! You're right.
We'd never get anywhere.
We'd just keep jumping back to where we started.
Also, we'd die horribly! You see, we're shielded in here.
So if we leave the time shelter and the button gets pressed less than ten seconds later, the antichronitons wouldn't know where to send us back to! We'd be shredded across the time-space continuum like human coleslaw! Yum! Observe.
Aw Listen, I know who stole the button.
I wasn't gonna tell, because I don't like being helpful.
But I do like ratting people out, so it was Fry! He took it to the Vampire State Building.
We've got to get to him.
But how? We can't leave the time shelter.
Hooray! I'm trapped in a tiny fun room with friends! Man, falling from a great height an infinite number of times can be stressful.
At least I have Leela's comforting scream to look forward to.
Fry! - Fry! - Whuh? Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, stop! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry hurry, hurry, hurry âª My boyfriend gave me a diamond - Hurry, hurry, hurry - Oh! Fry! We're here to rescue you! Professor? Oops.
Fry! Professor? He's he's dead.
It does look that way.
My poor sweet puddle! The button! I can still save him! No, don't! You'll shred me into a zillion It worked! But you killed the Professor! Yeah, but it worked! I died.
I'm dead! I'm gonna die! Come on, come on.
Fry, what's happening? Did you fall off the building? Actually, that's kind of a funny story He sure has a lot of blood for a skinny guy.
And I didn't want to go on living without you, so I jumped, and, well Oh That's so sweet, Fry.
You know those dreams where you're falling, and right before you hit the ground you wake up? Those are great.
If only there were a way to make Fry land softly, this would all be over.
Ooh, I know! My airbag! Leela! I'm coming to save the day! Hang on, Fry! You're just one death away from being saved! And then we can be marry me? Okay, I'm gonna run out there.
Then, you guys form a human bus and crash into me at 40 miles an hour.
Ready? Go! We did it! Wh-What happened? Did I break the button? I think you broke the universe.
Everything but us is frozen.
What are we gonna do? First, I'm gonna get back these earrings I loaned Amy three years ago.
After that, I don't know.
This is surreal.
Whatever we want is ours for the taking.
Hello? Anyone? I guess it's just us for all eternity.
Listen, Leela, I'm not sure what kind of life we can make together in this frozen time-sicle, but if it's not too weird will you still marry me? I would marry you even if you weren't the last man on Earth.
- What was that? - I don't know but I'm scared.
Well, maybe we just need some rest.
We can get married in the morning.
Except there won't be morning.
We can worry about that in the morning.
Do I, Philip J.
Fry, take you, Turanga Leela, to be my lawful wedded wife? You do.
Do I, Turanga Leela, take you, Philip J.
Fry, to be my lawful wedded husband? Uh yes? Absolutely.
There it is again! Leave my wife alone, you glimmer! It's okay, Fry.
If it keeps bugging us, we'll either kill it or adopt it.
Meanwhile, what do you say we get started on a very, very, very long honeymoon? I think it's about time we drank the champagne JanÃ¶s poured all those years ago.
May I read the toast I was going to make? Go for it.
I'm in no rush, after walking up 240 flights of steps.
And across those oceans.
""To us.
""If I could make one moment last forever, this is the one I would choose.
"" I'm glad you did.
It was a good life.
Kind of lonely, though? Maybe? I was never lonely.
Not even for a minute.
I guess we'll never figure out what that glimmer is.
Nope.
Pretty, though.
Hey, hey, wait it's doing something! I'll protect you.
Hi yow! Professor?! You're alive?! Yes, it's me.
Boy, did somebody hit you two with an old-and-ugly-stick.
I thought I killed you with the Time Button.
I thought so, too, at first.
But it seems I was simply rotated into an orthogonal time that runs at right angles to this one.
I've been tunneling for decades, searching every instant from yesterday to tomorrow.
We've been right now the whole time.
I wasn't looking for you, I was looking for the Time Button.
Oh! I landed on it and time froze.
I tried to fix it once, but then I got mad and hit it some more.
I guess it's good we didn't have children.
Oh, give me that, you senile old idiot! Oh, let me see that goes there lefty loosey, righty tighty, and fixed! What?! I could've fixed it that easily? You? Okay.
I've modded the device to release a single huge antichroniton blast.
It should rip us out of stasis, back to the instant before I conceived of the Time Button.
You mean we'll all get to live our lives over again? Oh, my, yes.
Even that nasty robot, what's-his-name.
Of course, we won't remember anything that's happened.
What do you say? Want to go around again? I do.
